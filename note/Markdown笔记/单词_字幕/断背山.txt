{\an8}{\pos(189.6,248)}怀俄明州  信号城



见鬼
Shit.



你们这两个家伙要是想找工作
You pair of deuces looking for work,



那就最好赶紧给我滚进来
I suggest you get your scrawny asses in here pronto.



在断背山上
Up on Brokeback,



林务局已经在配给土地内指定了露营地点
the Forest Service has got designated campsites on the allotments.



营地离我们放牧绵羊的地方有三四英里远
Them camps can be 3, 4 miles from where we pasture the woollies.



如果晚上没人照顾
Bad predator loss



就会因为被捕食而导致损失惨重
if there's nobody looking after them at night.



我需要的是一个守营人
Now, what I want is a camp tender



住在林务局规划的主营地里
to stay in the main camp, where the Forest Service says.



但是放牧人
But the herder,



得在羊群中偷偷支个小帐篷
he's gonna pitch a pup tent on the QT with the sheep



晚上睡在那里
and he's gonna sleep there.



你在营地吃早晚餐
You eat your supper and breakfast in camp,



但是晚上必须和羊群睡在一起
but you sleep with the sheep 100%.



不许生火  不能留下痕迹
No fire, don't leave no sign.



每天早上把帐篷收起来
You roll up that tent every morning



以防林务局来巡视
in case Forest Service snoops around.



喂
Yeah?



不行
No.



不行
No!



你这辈子都别想
Not on your fucking life.



带上你的狗  你的步枪  你睡在那里
You got your dogs, your 30-30, you sleep there.



去年夏天我损失了将近25%的羊
Last summer I had goddamn near 25% loss.



我不想重蹈覆辙
I don't want that again.



你
You.



每周五中午下山到桥上来
Fridays at noon, be down at the bridge



带上你的购物清单和骡子
with your grocery list and mules,



有人会把物资送到交接地点
and somebody with supplies will be there at the pick-up.



明天早上我们开卡车送你们去山口
Tomorrow morning we'll truck you up to the jump-off.



我叫杰克·特威斯特
Jack Twist.



我叫恩尼斯
Ennis.



你爸妈没告诉你你姓什么吗
Your folks just stop at Ennis?



德·玛尔
Del Mar.



很高兴认识你  恩尼斯·德·玛尔
Well, nice to know you, Ennis Del Mar.



这是我第二年来这里干活
My second year up here.



去年一场暴风雨  闪电劈死了42头羊
Last year, one storm, the lightning killed 42 sheep.



我都以为我要被焦臭味熏死了
Thought I'd asphyxiate from the smell.



阿吉雷把我狠狠地骂了一顿
Aguirre got all over my ass,



好像我能控制天气似的
like I was supposed to control the weather.



但总比给我爸打工要强
But beats working for my old man.



他永远都对我不满意
Can't please my old man, no way.



所以我才去参加牛仔竞技
That's why I took to rodeoing.



你玩过牛仔竞技吗
You ever rodeo?



就...偶尔吧
You know, I mean, once in a while.



能凑出报名费的时候
When I got the entry fee in my pocket.



你家是开农场的吗
Are you from ranch people?



嗯  曾经是
Yeah, I was.



父母把你赶出来了吗
Your folks run you off?



不  他们倒是把自己给"送走"了
No, they run themselves off.



整整43英里的直路  突然出现个转弯
There was one curve in the road in 43 miles,



他们没注意
and they miss it.



于是银行没收了农场
So the bank took the ranch



基本上是哥哥姐姐把我养大的
and my brother and sister, they raised me, mostly.



见鬼  太艰苦了
Shit, that's hard.



借个火  
Can I?



谢谢
Thank you.



别让它们乱跑
Don't let them stray.



不然乔会要你好看
Joe will have your ass if you do.



只有一个要求  永远不要订汤
Only thing, don't never order soup.



那些汤盒很难打包
Them soup boxes are hard to pack.



我不喝汤
Well, I don't eat soup.



小心点  那匹马很容易受惊
You wanna watch it there. That horse has a low startle point.



这世上没有能把我甩下来的小母马
Doubt there's a filly that could throw me.



我们走吧  除非你想整天坐在那里打结
Let's git, unless you wanna sit around tying knots all day.



{\an8}{\pos(179.128,189.624)}豆子



见鬼
Oh, shit.



我等不及想拥有自己的土地了
Can't wait till I get my own spread



然后我就不用再忍受乔·阿吉雷的折腾了
and I won't have to put up with Joe Aguirre's crap no more.



我也在攒钱置业
I'm saving for a place myself.



等我下山  阿尔玛和我
Alma and me, we're gonna get married



我们就要结婚了
when I come down off this mountain.



见鬼  和羊睡在一起  不许生火
Shit, that stay with the sheep, no fire bullshit.



阿吉雷无权要求我们违反规定
Aguirre got no right making us do something against the rules.



不要再吃豆子了
No more beans.



该死  妈的
Damn. Shit!



我觉得这不太好
I don't know.



有什么问题吗
Something wrong?



是啊  那个...
Yeah, so what...



为什么没给我们买奶粉和土豆
Why didn't we get the powdered milk and the spuds?



只有这些
That's all we got.



这是下周的单子
Here's next week's.



我还以为你不喝汤
Thought you didn't eat soup.



是啊  但是豆子吃腻了
Yeah, well, I'm sick of beans.



这么快就吃腻了  夏天才刚开始
Too early in the summer to be sick of beans.



走吧
Come on.



快走  快走
Come on. Come on.



等等  别跑
Hold on. Hold on.



见鬼
Shit.



快回来
Come back here!



好了  去他的
All right. Fuck it.



你个混蛋
Okay, you bastard.



你到底去哪儿了
Where the hell you been?



我在山上放了一天羊
Been up with the sheep all day,



下来饿得要死  结果只有豆子
I get down here hungry as hell and all I find is beans.



到底发生什么事了  恩尼斯
What in the hell happened, Ennis?



我碰上熊了
I come on a bear is what happened.



该死的马受惊了  骡子也跑了
Goddamn horse spooked and the mules took off



食物掉得到处都是
and scattered food everywhere.



我们只剩豆子了
Beans is about all we got left.



有威士忌之类的吗
Got whiskey or something?



蠢骡子
Dumb-ass mule.



难以置信  该死的
I can't believe that. God damn.



让我看看
Let me see.



该死
Shit.



我们得想办法解决食物问题
Well, we gotta do something about this food situation.



也许我可以杀一头羊
Maybe I'll shoot one of the sheep.



真有你的  要是阿吉雷发现怎么办
Yeah, what if Aguirre finds out, huh?



我们是来保护羊群的  不是来吃它们的
We're supposed to guard the sheep, not eat them.



你是有什么毛病  总共有上千头羊
What's the matter with you? There are a thousand of them.



我还是吃豆子吧
I'll stick with beans.



我不吃
Well, I won't.



受够你的烂枪法了
Getting tired of your dumb-ass missing.



我们快过去
Let's get a move on.



可不想被渔猎局抓到我们猎杀麋鹿
Don't want the Game and Fish to catch us with no elk.



这边  该死
Come on. Shit.



我每天在路上花四个小时
I'm commuting four hours a day.



我过来吃早餐  然后回去守羊
I come in for breakfast, I go back to the sheep.



晚上把它们安顿好
Evening, get them bedded down.



再来吃晚餐  然后回去守羊
Come in for supper, go back to the sheep.



半个晚上都在提防有没有土狼
Spend half the night checking for damn coyotes.



阿吉雷无权要求我这么做
Aguirre got no right to make me do this.



你想交换吗  我不介意去山上睡
You wanna switch? I wouldn't mind sleeping out there.



那不是重点
That ain't the point.



重点是我们都应该待在这个营地
The point is, we both ought to be in this camp.



该死的小帐篷闻起来比猫尿还臭
Goddamn pup tent smells like cat piss or worse.



我不介意去山上
I wouldn't mind being out there.



那我很乐意跟你交换
Well, I'm happy to switch with you,



但我得提醒你  我的厨艺不行
but I warn you, I can't cook worth a damn.



不过我很擅长用开罐器
I am pretty good with a can opener, though.



那你的厨艺不可能比我的差
You can't be no worse than me, then.



吃吧
Here you go.



告诉你  你可没什么机会睡觉
You won't get much sleep, I'll tell you that.



好吧  走
Yup. Come on.



昨晚打死了一头土狼
Shot a coyote up there.



那混蛋个头很大
It's a big son of a bitch.



蛋蛋有苹果那么大
He had balls on him the size of apples.



我看他能生吞一头骆驼
He looked like he could eat himself a camel.



你要用热水吗
You want some of this hot water?



都是你的了
It's all yours.



我不怎么参加牛仔竞技
I don't rodeo much myself.



在一头牲畜上摇摆八秒钟有什么意义吗
I mean, what's the point of riding some piece of stock for eight seconds?



钱就是很好的意义
Money's a good point.



有道理
True enough.



前提是赚钱的过程中不被踩踏
If you don't get stomped winning it, huh?



是啊
Yeah.



我爸曾是骑牛的
Well, my old man, he was a bull rider.



谢谢
Thank you.



在他那个年代挺出名的
Pretty well-known in his day.



尽管他把诀窍藏在心里
Though he kept his secrets to himself.



什么都没教过我  从没来看过我竞技
Never taught me a thing, never once come to see me ride.



你哥哥姐姐对你好吗
Your brother and sister do right by you?



我父母去世后  他们尽力而为了
They did the best they could after my folks was gone.



毕竟我父母留下的家财只有
Considering they didn't leave us nothing but



咖啡罐里的24块钱
$24 in a coffee can.



我上了一年高中
I got me a year of high school.



当时皮卡车还没有采用自动换挡系统
That was before the transmission went on the pickup.



然后我姐走了
And then my sis left.



她嫁给了一个钻井工  搬去了卡斯珀
She married a roughneck, moved to Casper.



我和我哥
And me and my brother,



我们去沃兰附近的一个农场找了份工作
we went and got ourselves some work on a ranch up near Worland.



直到我19岁  然后他也结婚了
Till I was 19. Then he got married.



就没有我的容身之处了
And no more room for me.



所以我才会来这里干活
That's how come me end up here.



怎么了
What?



你刚刚说的话  比你过去两周里说的还多
Man, that's more words than you've spoke in the past two weeks.



见鬼  这比我一年里说的话还多
Hell, that's the most I've spoke in a year.



不过我爸  他很会套绳
But my dad, he was a fine roper.



可是没怎么参加过竞技
Didn't rodeo much, though.



他认为参加竞技的牛仔都是神经病
He thought rodeo cowboys was all fuck-ups.



才不是
The hell they are.



瞧吧
There you go.



我要把它的内脏给刺穿
I'm spurring his guts out!



向看台上的姑娘们挥手
Waving to the girls in the stands!



它把我高高甩起来
He's kicking me to high heaven,



但它甩不掉我  甩不掉
but he don't jackboard me! No!



看来我爸说得没错
I think my dad was right.



帐篷不对劲
Tent don't look right.



反正它不会长腿跑了  别管了
Well, it ain't going nowhere. Let it be.



你那口琴听起来也不太对劲
That harmonica don't sound quite right either.



那是因为我被那匹小母马甩下来时  把它压扁了
That's 'cause it got kind of flattened when that mare threw me.



是吗
Oh, yeah?



你不是说那匹小母马不可能把你甩下来吗
I thought you said that mare couldn't throw you.



它走运而已
She got lucky.



要是我走运了  那把口琴应该直接被压烂
Yeah, well, if I got lucky, that harmonica would've broke in two.



♪我知道我会在最后一天见到你♪
♪I know I shall meet you on that final day♪



♪行走水上的耶稣  带我走吧♪
♪Water-walking Jesus, take me away♪



很不错
Very good.



是啊
Oh, yeah.



我妈妈相信圣灵降临日
My mama, she believes in the Pentecost.



是吗
Oh, yeah?



圣灵降临日到底是什么
What exactly is the Pentecost?



我父母是卫理公会派教徒
I mean, my folks, they was Methodist.



圣灵降临日
The Pentecost.



不知道  我不知道圣灵降临日是什么
I don't know, I don't know what the Pentecost is.



我妈从来没跟我解释过
Mom never explained it to me.



我猜是世界末日的时候
I guess it's when the world ends



像你我这样的家伙  我们要下地狱
and fellas like you and me, we march off to hell.



说你自己就行了
Speak for yourself.



也许你是个罪人  但我还没有过犯罪的机会
You may be a sinner, but I ain't yet had the opportunity.



谢谢
Thank you.



该死
Shit!



我上山守羊去了
I'm gonna go up to the sheep now.



让它们尝尝厉害
Give them hell.



不行  我...
No, I'm...



你几乎站不起来
You can hardly stand.



现在过去已经太晚了
It's too late to go to them sheep.



你有多余的毯子吗
Well, you got an extra blanket?



我就在这儿打个地铺  稍微打个盹
I'll just roll up out here, grab 40 winks



天一亮就走
and I'll ride out at first light.



等火熄了  你的屁股都会被冻掉的
You'll freeze your ass off when that fire dies down.



那也挺好的
Oh, that's good.



你还是进帐篷睡吧
You're better off sleeping in the tent.



随你吧
All right.



恩尼斯
Ennis!



干什么
What?



快别哼哼了  你就进来吧
Just quit your yammering and get in here!



别紧张  别紧张
Come on, come on.



你在干什么
What ya doin'?



晚饭时见
See you for supper.



好  驾
Yeah. Come on.



快跑
Come on.



那种事只能有一次  绝不能再有了
This is a one-shot thing we got going on here.



那是我们之间的事  与别人无关
It's nobody's business but ours.



你知道我不是同性恋
You know I ain't queer.



我也不是
Me, neither.



对不起
I'm sorry.



没事的
It's all right.



没事的
It's all right.



靠在我身上  来
Lie back. Come on.



特威斯特
Twist.



你叔叔哈罗德患肺炎住院了
Your Uncle Harold's in the hospital with pneumonia.



医生们觉得他可能熬不过这关
Docs don't expect he'll make it.



你母亲让我告诉你  所以我过来一趟
Your ma sent me to tell you, so here I am.



坏消息
Bad news.



我想我在这里也做不了什么
There ain't nothing I can do about it up here, I guess.



你去了那里也帮不上多少忙
There's not much you can do about it down there, neither.



除非你会治疗肺炎
Not unless you can cure pneumonia.



该死  天呐
God damn! Jesus!



我今晚不上去的话羊群会走散的
Them sheep will drift if I don't get back up there tonight!



这么大的风暴  你会人仰马翻的
You'll get pitched off your mount in a storm like this.



到时候你就会希望自己没那么做了
You'll wish you hadn't tried it!



-太冷了  -快拉上
- It's too cold! - Close it up!



我们现在该怎么办
What are we supposed to do now, huh?



过去把智利人的羊
Get on in there and untangle them



跟我们的羊区分开
Chilean sheep out of ours, I guess.



在哪儿来着  妈的
Oh, where is it? Shit!



天呐  半数羊身上打的标记都没了
God, half the goddamn paint brands have wore off!



总得试一试 
We gotta try.



至少我们可以把数量给阿吉雷凑齐
The least we can do is get the count right for Aguirre.



去他妈的阿吉雷
Fuck Aguirre!



是啊  去他妈的阿吉雷
Oh, yeah, fuck Aguirre.



万一我们以后还得给他干活儿呢
What if we need to work for him again?



你想过这个吗
You think of that?



我们得坚持到底  杰克
We gotta stick this out, Jack.



你再不停下来  羊群又要被吓跑了
You'll run them sheep off again if you don't quiet down.



你在干什么
What are you doing?



阿吉雷又来过了
Aguirre came by again.



说我叔叔最终还是没死
Says my uncle didn't die after all.



还让把帐篷拆了
Says bring them down.



拆了  为什么  现在才八月中旬
Bring them down, why? It's the middle of August.



说是又有风暴要来了  从太平洋过来的
Says there's a storm coming, moving in from the Pacific.



比这次还要猛烈
Worse than this one.



那次雪下了一个钟头都不到  对吧
That snow barely stuck an hour. Huh?



再说  那个狗娘养的
Besides, that son of a bitch,



他要少给我们一整个月的工资
he's cutting us out a whole month's pay.



这是不对的
It ain't right.



你要是缺钱的话  我可以借你一笔  兄弟
I can spare you a loan, bud, if you're short on cash.



等我们到了信号城后给你
Give it to you when we get to Signal.



我不要你的钱
I don't need your money, huh?



我又不是要饭的  妈的

该死的
Oh, shit!

过来  你还好吗
Come here. You okay?

- You okay? - Yeah.



这里面有些羊不是跟你们上山的那批
Some of these never went up there with you.



数目也没有达到我的预期
Count ain't what I'd hoped for, neither.



你们这些牧场工  就这差劲的德行
You ranch stiffs, you ain't never no good.



要加点油吗
Wanna give it some gas?



我他妈居然把衬衫忘在山上了
I can't believe I left my damn shirt up there.



是啊
Yeah.



你明年夏天还会来吗
You gonna do this again next summer?



也许不了
Well, maybe not.



我说过的  我和阿尔玛11月就要结婚了
Like I said, me and Alma is getting married in November.



所以
So,



我想我会在大农场找点活儿干
I'll try to get something on a ranch, I guess.



你呢
And you?



可能会去我爸那儿
Might go up to my daddy's place and



冬天的时候给他搭把手
give him a hand through the winter.



我可能会再来的
I might be back.



要是军队不招我入伍的话
If the Army don't get me.



那以后应该还能再见到你吧
Well, I guess I'll see you around, huh?



是的
Right.



你他妈看什么看
What the fuck are you looking at?



"宽恕我们的过错
"And forgive us our trespasses..."



正如我们宽恕他人的过错
as we forgive those who trespass against us.



不叫我们遇见诱惑  救我们脱离凶恶
"Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.



因为国度  权柄  荣耀  皆是你

直到永远  阿门"

No, please don't!



我老婆劝我辞了这份工作
My old lady's trying to get me to quit this job.



她说我一把年纪

别再铲沥青把腰给折了
to be breaking my back shoveling asphalt.



我告诉她  强健的腰和愚弱的大脑
I told her strong backs and weak minds



是我们家的遗传特征
runs in the family.



她却不觉得这话好笑
She didn't think that was too funny.



我告诉她这样让我身体健康
I told her it keeps me fit.



-早上好  -早上好

我昨晚到的
Pulled in last night.



不想吵醒你
Didn't want to wake you up.



不  我正好...
Oh, no, I was just...



我想在警长来之前告诉你
I thought I'd tell you before the Sergeant showed up.



把拖车停在海滩上是违法的
Parking this trailer on the beach is illegal.



进来
Yeah!



什么风把你吹来了
Well, look what the wind blew in.



你好  阿吉雷先生
Hi, Mr. Aguirre.



我想知道你今年夏天还需不需要帮手了
I was wondering if you was needing any help this summer.



你这是在浪费时间
You're wasting your time here.



怎么  你这里什么活儿都没有吗
What, you ain't got nothing?



断背山上什么都没有吗
Nothing up on Brokeback?



至少我没有活儿给你干
I ain't got no work for you.



恩尼斯·德·玛尔没来过吧
Ennis Del Mar ain't been around, has he?



你们两个在山上找到了消遣时间的好方法啊
You boys sure found a way to make the time pass up there.



特威斯特
Twist,



给你们工钱
you guys wasn't getting paid to



不是叫你们让狗去照看羊群
leave the dogs baby-sit the sheep



自己在那儿操屁股玩
while you stemmed the rose.



现在滚出我的拖车
Now get the hell out of my trailer.



姑娘们都还好吗
How my girls doing?



挺好  珍妮还是有点流鼻涕
All right. Jenny's still got a runny nose.



恩尼斯  你能帮小阿尔玛擦下鼻子吗
Ennis, could you wipe Alma Jr.'s nose?



要是有三只手的话我就替她擦了
If I had three hands, I could.



姑娘们还好吗
Girls all right?

Yeah.



珍妮不咳嗽了
Jenny stopped her coughing.



我觉得这周末该带孩子们去趟镇上
I think I should take the girls into town this weekend.



给她们买个冰淇淋什么的
Get them an ice cream. Something.



我们不能搬到镇上住吗
Can't we move to town?



我真是受够这些无聊的老牧场了
I'm tired of these lonesome old ranches.



都没有人陪小阿尔玛玩
No one's around for Junior to play with.



再说  我也担心珍妮
Besides, I'm scared for Jenny,



担心哪天她的哮喘又发作
scared if she has another one of them bad asthma spells.



不行  镇上的房租太贵了

里弗顿有便宜的房子  就在洗衣店那边

你要是愿意的话也可以把这里打理得很好
I bet you could fix this place up real nice if you wanted to.



恩尼斯

我知道你也会喜欢的
I know you'd like it, too.



真正的家  也有其他孩子陪女儿们玩
Real home, other kids for the girls to play with.



不像你小时候那样孤单
Not so lonely like you were raised.



你也不希望她们孤单  对不对
You don't want them to be so lonely, do you?



是的
Yeah.



过来
Come here.



现在没这么孤单了吧
It ain't so lonely now, is it?



你确定孩子们都睡着了吗
Are you sure the girls are asleep?



是的
Yeah.



过来
Come here.



恩尼斯

让它狂暴起来  小子们
Let her rip and snort, boys!



杰克·特威斯特  拼命坚持着
Jack Twist, hanging on for dear life!



他摔下来了  当心  伙计
And down he goes! Watch out there, fella!



他冲你来了  小丑们上场
He's coming for you. Send in the clowns!



-好吧  特威斯特先生骑得还不错  -妈的
- Okay, a fine ride by Mr. Twist. - Shit!



一共四秒
Four seconds for him.



给他们一点掌声吧  各位  我们的竞技场小丑
Give them a hand, folks, our very own rodeo clowns!



给我们来杯啤酒  道格
Give us a beer, Doug.



吉姆的啤酒我请了
I'd like to buy Jimbo here a beer.



我合作过的最棒的竞技场小丑
Best damn rodeo clown I've ever worked with.



不用了  谢谢  牛仔
No thanks, cowboy.



我要是让每一个从牛背上摔下来的人
If I was to let every rodeo hand I pulled a bull off of



都请我喝酒的话  我早就成酒鬼了
buy me liquor, I'd have been a alcoholic long ago.



把公牛从你们牛仔身边引开是我的工作
Pulling bulls off of you buckaroos is just my job.



你的钱省着交下次的入场费吧  牛仔
So save your money for your next entry fee, cowboy.



你试过套牛犊吗
You ever try calf roping?



我他妈看起来像买得起套牛马的人吗
Do I look like I can afford a fucking roping horse?



我们要不要再近一点
Shouldn't we move a little closer?



不  还是别了  珍妮会害怕的
No. Come on, let's don't. Jenny'll get scared.



你看这些人
Look at this crowd!



这么多人里一定有不少小骚货
Bound to be a lot of pussy on the hoof in a crowd like this.



满怀爱国情绪
All swelled up with patriotic feeling



准备像青蛙那样被操
and ready to be humped like a frog.



你觉得哪儿的女人最好操
So, where do you figure the most pussy is at?



拉斯维加斯还是加利福尼亚
Las Vegas or California?



我不知道  但要是在蒙大拿

You finish your meal, and then you can watch the game.



爸
Daddy?



爸
Daddy.



真是的  我们又不用眼睛吃饭
Hell, we don't eat with our eyes.



你也希望儿子长大能成为男子汉不是吗  女儿
You want your boy to grow up to be a man, don't you, Daughter?



男孩子就应该看橄榄球
Boys should watch football.



除非他先吃完饭
Not until he finishes eating the meal



这些可是他妈花了三个小时做好的
that his mama took three hours to fix.



你给我坐下  你个老混蛋
Now you sit down, you old son of a bitch!



这是我家  这是我儿子
This is my house, this is my child



你只是我的客人  你现在坐好
and you are my guest. Now you sit down



不然我就狠狠地揍你这傲慢自大的混蛋
before I knock your ignorant ass into next week.



爸  跟我说说你在牛仔竞技比赛上骑野马的事
Daddy, tell about when you rode broncs in the rodeo.



那个故事很短  宝贝
Well, that's a short story, honey.



我只在那野马上坚持了大概三秒钟
It was only about three seconds I was on that bronc.



然后我就被甩上天了
The next thing I knew, I was flying through the air,



不过我可不像你和珍妮  是在天上飞的小天使
only I was no angel like you and Jenny here.



我没有翅膀
I didn't have no wings.



那就是我骑野马事业的故事
And that's the story of my saddle bronc career.



给
There you go.



你应该再找个人结婚  恩尼斯
You ought to get married again, Ennis.



我和女儿们都很担心你一个人这么单着
Me and the girls worry about you being alone so much.



一朝被蛇咬...
Well, once burned...



你还和杰克·特威斯特去钓鱼吗
You still go fishing with Jack Twist?



不怎么去了
Not often.



我曾经好奇过
You know, I used to wonder



为什么你从没带过鳟鱼回家
how come you never brought any trouts home.



你总是说你们抓到了很多鱼
You always said you caught plenty



而且你也知道我和女儿们有多爱吃鱼
and you know how me and the girls like fish.



所以有一天晚上我打开了你的鱼篓
So, one night, I got your creel case open



就在你启程的前一天晚上
night before you went on one of your little trips.



五年过去了  价签还在上面
Price tag still on it after five years.



然后我在线尾绑了一张纸条
And I tied a note to the end of the line.



写着"你好恩尼斯  带点鱼回家  爱你的阿尔玛"
It said, "Hello, Ennis, bring some fish home. Love, Alma."



后来你回来了  看起来高兴极了
And then you come back looking all perky



还说你们抓到了很多褐鳟  全吃光了
and said you caught a bunch of browns and you ate them up.



你还记得吗
Do you remember?



我一找到机会就打开了鱼篓看
I looked in that case first chance I got



而我的纸条仍然好好地绑在绳尾
and there was my note still tied there.



那鱼线就从来没有碰过水
That line hadn't touched water in its life.



那并不能说明什么  阿尔玛
That don't mean nothing, Alma.



别想再骗我了  恩尼斯
Don't try and fool me no more, Ennis.



我知道那意味着什么
I know what that means.



杰克·特威斯特
Jack Twist.



阿尔玛
Alma.



"下流胚"杰克
Jack "Nasty"!



你们上山并不是去钓鱼的  你和他...
You didn't go up there to fish. You and him...



你给我好好听着  你对这事一无所知
Now you listen to me, you don't know nothing about it.



我要叫门罗了
I'm going to yell for Monroe.



你敢叫  我就揍趴你
You do it and I'll make you eat the fucking floor.



滚出去
Get out!



你也是
And you, too!



滚出去  滚出去
Get out! Get out!



滚出我的家  恩尼斯·德·玛尔
Get out of my house, Ennis Del Mar!



听到了吗  滚出去
You hear me? You get out!



爸爸
Daddy?



阿尔玛
Alma?



再见  爸爸
Bye, Daddy!



再见
Bye.



混蛋  走路不长眼睛
Asshole, watch where you're going!



天呐  你...
Jesus. What...



我的天
Jesus...



你这个白痴
You stupid fuck!



该死的
God damn!



老天  该死的
God. God damn.



操
Oh, fuck!



去死
Damn it!



我只是说  挣钱有什么用呢
All I'm saying is, what's the point of making it?



不是全交税了  就是通货膨胀贬值了
If the taxes don't get it, the inflation will eat it all up.



你应该看看露琳
You should see Lureen punching



在计算器上敲数字的样子
numbers in her adding machine.



想从账本里找到额外的钱  眼睛都要看瞎了
Hunting for extra zeros, her eyes getting smaller and smaller.



就像看一只兔子  因为屁股后面
It's like watching a rabbit trying to



追着一头狼  就拼命往蛇洞里钻
squeeze into a snake hole with a coyote on its tail.



要我说  这就是上流社会才有的"乐趣"
That's some high class entertainment, if you ask me.



不管怎么说
For what it's worth.



你和露琳  关系还好吗
You and Lureen, it's normal and all?



当然
Sure.



她从没怀疑过吗
She don't ever suspect?



你有没有感觉到过
You ever get the feeling,



我也说不上来
I don't know,



进城的时候
when you're in town



有人看着你
and someone looks at you



一脸怀疑  好像他已经知道了一样
suspicious, like he knows.



当你走在街上  大家都向你看过来
Then you go out on the pavement and everyone's looking at you



好像他们也知道了一样
like they all know, too?



也许你应该离开那里  知道吗
Well, maybe you ought to get out of there, you know?



重新找个住处  比如德州
Find yourself someplace different, maybe Texas.



德州
Texas?



好啊  也许你能说服阿尔玛
Sure, and maybe you can convince Alma



让你和露琳收养我们的孩子
to let you and Lureen adopt the girls.



然后我们就能永远在一起  一起放羊
Then we could just live together, herding sheep.



你的老岳父会给你很多钱
And it'll rain money from L.D. Newsome



连小河里流的都是威士忌
and whiskey will flow in the streams.



杰克  那可真是"明智"的建议
Jack, that's real smart.



去死吧  恩尼斯·德·玛尔
Go to hell, Ennis Del Mar.



你想过这种悲惨的日子  随便你
You wanna live your miserable fucking life? Then go right ahead.



-好啊  -我就是那么一说
- Fine. - I was just thinking out loud.



是啊  你的想法"真好"
Yup, you're a real thinker there.



该死的
God damn...



杰克•特威斯特  什么都计划好了是吗
Jack fucking Twist. Got it all figured out, ain't he?



好的  宝贝
All right, hon.



我刚下班  想跳支舞吗
Just finished my shift. Wanna dance?



我正要...
I was on my way to the...



我叫凯西  凯西·卡特莱特
I'm Cassie. Cassie Cartwright.



我叫恩尼斯·德·玛尔
Ennis. Del Mar.



可别再让我跳舞了
No more dancing for me, I hope.



-你安全了  -是吗
- You're safe. - Yeah?



我脚疼了
My feet hurt.



工作太辛苦吗
Hard work, is it?



是啊  像你这样的醉鬼一杯接一杯点
Yeah, drunks like you demanding beer after beer,



还抽烟  很累的
smoking. Gets tiresome.



你是做什么的  恩尼斯·德·玛尔
What do you do, Ennis Del Mar?



我今天阉割了小牛
Well, earlier today, I was castrating calves.



你干什么
What are you doing?



想找人给我按按脚  笨蛋
Trying to get a foot rub, dummy.



好吧
All right.



舒服吗
That good?



之后我在南卫理公会大学加入了ΔΔΔ姐妹会
And then I pledged Tri Delt at SMU.



我当年是一点都没想到
And I sure never thought



我会沦落到柴尔德里斯这种小地方
I'd end up in a poky little place like Childress.



然后我在农科大学生赛上遇到了兰道尔
Then I met old Randall here at an Aggie game



当时他修的是畜牧学
and he was an animal husbandry major.



我们才到这里一个月  
So we've been here for a month



他就在罗伊·泰勒的农场找了份工头的工作
and he got the foreman job over at Roy Taylor's ranch.



不管怎么样  我就在这里安家了
Like it or not, here I am!



你是ΔΔΔ姐妹会的吗  我是ΚΦ姐妹会的
Was you Tri Delt? I was Kappa Phi myself.



虽然我们不是同一个姐妹会的
Well, even though we ain't quite sorority sisters,



但是我们恐怕都得独自跳舞了  露琳
we just may have to dance with ourselves, Lureen.



我们的丈夫对跳舞可一点兴趣都没有
Our husbands ain't the least bit interested in dancing.



他们一点节奏感都没有
They ain't got a smidgen of rhythm between them.



说起来很好笑  不是吗
It's funny, isn't it?



丈夫总是不愿意与自己的妻子跳舞
Husbands don't never seem to wanna dance with their wives.



你说这是为什么呢  杰克
Why do you think that is, Jack?



不知道  没想过
I don't know, I never give it any thought.



想跳舞吗
Wanna dance?



当然  谢谢
Yes, thank you.



你介意吗
Do you mind?



不  不介意  请便
No, it's all right. Go ahead.



好的
All right.



失陪
Pardon us.



谢谢你邀请我跳舞
Thank you for asking me to dance with you.



我很感激  兰道尔就从来不邀请我
I really appreciate that. Randall never does.



上次我们一起跳舞应该还是在我们的婚礼上
Last time I did, I think it was our wedding.



{\an8}欢迎来到1978年柴尔德里斯县儿童之家慈善晚宴



多亏当时你和露琳出现了
It's a good thing you and Lureen happened along when you did



否则我们肯定
or else we'd still be stuck



还被困在路边的坏皮卡车里呢
on the side of the road in that darn pickup.



我就跟兰道尔说应该开轿车的
I told Randall we ought to take the car.



当然了  他是从来不听我的
Of course, he'd never listen to me.



就算他明天就要聋了  今天他也不会听我说话
He wouldn't listen to me if he was going deaf tomorrow.



我跟他说了光用口香糖和打包钢丝
I told him it'd take more than chewing gum and baling wire



修不好那辆车
to fix that pickup.



当然了  他本身也不太懂机械
Well, he's never been very mechanical, though.



来这边问问...
Come over here and ask...



你有没有发现
You ever notice how a woman



女人在参加派对前总要扑粉
will powder her nose before she goes to a party?



而且离开派对时还要再补一次
And then she'll powder it again once the party's over.



一回家就睡觉为什么还要补粉
I mean, why powder your nose just to go home and go to bed?



不知道
Don't know.



就算我想知道
Even if I wanted to know,



我和拉夏说话时  也插不上空问这个问题
I couldn't get a word in with Lashawn long enough to ask.



那女人就是个话匣子
Woman talks a blue streak.



很有活力的女人
Lively little gal.



你会喜欢为罗伊·泰勒工作的
You'll like working for Roy Taylor.



罗伊很可靠
He's solid, Roy.



是啊  罗伊  他挺好的
Yeah, Roy. He's a good old boy.



他在肯普湖有个小木屋
He's got a little cabin down on Lake Kemp.



简陋的小房子  还有条小船
Got a crappie house, little boat.



他说我想用随时都能用
Said I could use it whenever I want.



哪个周末我们应该一起去一次
We ought to go down there some weekend.



喝点威士忌  钓钓鱼
Drink a little whiskey, fish some.



换换心情  你说呢
Get away, you know?



就离南卫理公会大学不远
That was right out of SMU.



我本来可以在北达拉斯做任何想做的工作
I could've had my pick of pretty much any job in North Dallas.



我选了尼曼百货  那可是场灾难
So my pick was Neiman Marcus, which was a disaster



因为亲爱的  面对衣服我毫无抵抗力
because, honey, where clothes is concerned, I got no resistance.



我花的比赚的多
I was spending more than I made.



兰道尔的工资可不够我花的
More than Randall ever will make.



我们来这里是想着
We come out here thinking



经营大农场还是老式那一套  大帽子  万宝路
that ranching was still big hats and Marlboros.



天  我们可过时了对吧
Boy, were we behind the times.



小阿尔玛  准备好了吗
Hey there, Junior. You ready?



你是怎么想的
What do you think?



你觉得你父亲会安定下来吗
Your daddy ever gonna see fit to settle down again?



不知道  也许他不适合结婚
Don't know. Maybe he's not the marrying kind.



你觉得他不适合吗
You don't think so?



还是觉得我不适合他
Or you don't think I'm the one for him?



你挺好的
You're good enough.



你话不多  但是意思清楚明白
You don't say much, but you get your point across.



抱歉  我无意冒犯
Sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.



好了
All right.



你可不能坐下  牛仔
You're staying on your feet, cowboy.



失陪  亲爱的
Excuse me, darling.



下周末去教堂做完礼拜  我来接你和珍妮
So I'll pick you and Jenny up next weekend, after church.



好
Fine.



你还好吗
You all right?



挺好
Yes.



真的吗
Are you sure?



爸爸  我在想  因为家里马上就要添个孩子
Daddy, I was thinking, what with the new baby and all,



妈妈和门罗对我都很严格
Ma and Monroe have been awful strict on me.



比对珍妮还严格
More on me than Jenny even.



我在想  我能不能
I was thinking, maybe I could...



能不能搬过去和你住
Maybe I could come stay with you.



我会帮上很多忙的  我保证
I'd be an awful good help, I know I would.



你知道我照顾不了你
Now, you know I ain't set up for that.



马上就要赶拢牲畜了
With the roundup coming,



我都没时间回家
I won't ever be home.



没事  爸爸
It's all right, Daddy.



我不是说我不愿意
I'm not saying that I wouldn't...



没事  我理解
It's all right, I understand.



那周日见吧
Well, see you on Sunday, then.



再见
Bye.



再见  亲爱的
Bye, sweetheart.



今晚肯定要下雪了
Going to snow tonight for sure.



是啊
Yup.



这么久了  你都没找到合适的人再婚吗
All this time and you ain't found nobody else to marry?

to a good-looking little gal over in Riverton.



她是个服务员
She's a waitress.



想去上护士学校还是什么的
Wants to go to nursing school or something.



我不知道
I don't know.



你和露琳呢
What about you and Lureen?



在机器这行业  无论多难搞的客户露琳都能应付
Lureen's good at making hard deals in the machinery business



但是在婚姻方面
but as far as our marriage goes,



我们已经形同陌路
we could do it over the phone.



我现在和鲁特斯那边
I kind of got this thing going



一个农场工头的妻子有点情况
with a ranch foreman's wife over in Rutters.



-什么  -我每次偷偷溜去见她
- What? - I'm bound to get shot



都担心会死在露琳或者她丈夫手上
by Lureen or her husband each time I slip off to see her.



我看你也是活该
You probably deserve it.



跟你说
Tell you what.



说老实话
The truth is,



我有时候特别想你  想到我都受不了了
sometimes I miss you so much, I can hardly stand it.



我想我要回闪平镇一趟
I guess I'll head up on to Lightning Flat.



去父母家住两天
See the folks for a day or two.



有件事我一直想跟你说  兄弟
There's something I been meaning to tell you, bud.



我下次再来这里可能要到11月了
Well, it's likely November before I can come out here again.



等牲畜被运走后  还要赶在冬饲开始之前
After we ship stock and before winter feeding starts again.



11月
November.



8月怎么就不行了
What in the hell ever happened to August?



老天呐  恩尼斯
Christ, Ennis.



你憋了一整周  非要到现在才说
You know, you had a fucking week to say some little word about this.



为什么我们总是大冷天相聚
Why is it we're always in the frigging cold?



我们应该去南边暖和点的地方
We ought to go south where it's warm, you know!



我们应该去墨西哥
We ought to go to Mexico.



墨西哥
Mexico?



杰克  你知道我的  
Hell, Jack, you know me.



我最远的旅行
About all the traveling I ever done



就是绕着咖啡壶找壶把
is around a coffee pot, looking for the handle.



好了  杰克  别生我的气
Come on, Jack. Lighten up on me.



11月我们可以打猎
We can hunt in November.



打头麋鹿
Kill us a nice elk.



我试试能不能再借借唐·洛的小木屋
I'll try if I can get Don Wroe's cabin again.



那年我们在那里玩得很开心  不是吗
We had a good time that year, didn't we?



时间永远不够  永远不够
There's never enough time, never enough.



你要知道  朋友
You know, friend,



这种情况太他妈让人苦恼了
this is a goddamn bitch of an unsatisfactory situation.



你以前能常来
You used to come away easy.



现在见你像见教皇那么难
Now it's like seeing the Pope.



杰克  我得干活
Jack, I got to work.



要是早些年  我就不干了
In them earlier days, I'd just quit the job.



你...
You...



你已经忘了一直身无分文的感受了
You forget what it's like being broke all the time.



听说过抚养费吗
You ever hear of child support?



我告诉你
I'll tell you this,



我没法辞职  也请不到假
I can't quit this one and I can't get the time off.



这次出来就够难的了
It was hard enough getting this time.



牲畜交易会就在8月
The trade-off was August.



你还有更好的主意吗
Well, you got a better idea?



曾经有过
I did, once.



曾经有过
You did, once.



你是不是去墨西哥了  杰克·特威斯特
Well, have you been to Mexico, Jack Twist?



因为我听说墨西哥有适合你这号人的东西
'Cause I hear what they got in Mexico for boys like you.



没错  我就是去墨西哥了  有问题吗
Hell, yes, I've been to Mexico. Is that a fucking problem?



这话我就跟你说一次  该死的杰克·特威斯特
I'm going to tell you this one time, Jack fucking Twist.



我可不是说着玩的
And I ain't fooling.



我不知道的那些事 
What I don't know,



所有我不知道的那些烂事
all them things that I don't know



要是让我知道了  我就要了你的命
could get you killed if I come to know them.



我没开玩笑
I ain't joking.



行啊  那你也听听  这话我就说一次
Yeah, well try this one, and I'll say it just once.



说啊
Go ahead!



我告诉你
I'll tell you what.



我们本来可以幸福地过一辈子
We could have had a good life together.



真正的幸福生活  有块我们自己的地
Fucking real good life. Had us a place of our own!



但你不想要  恩尼斯
But you didn't want it, Ennis.



所以现在我们只有断背山的回忆
So what we got now is Brokeback Mountain!



一切都是建立在那上面的
Everything's built on that!



我们只有那些回忆  没别的了
That's all we got, boy. Fucking all.



如果你没法知道其他事  我希望你至少明白这点
So I hope you know that, if you don't never know the rest!



该死的
God damn it.



你数数看过去20年
You count the damn few times



我们就相聚过几回
that we have been together in nearly 20 years



而你还栓我栓得这么紧
and you measure the short fucking leash you keep me on



还问我什么墨西哥的事
and then you ask me about Mexico



说你要杀了我
and you tell me you'll kill me



就因为我想要几乎没得到过的东西吗
for needing something I don't hardly never get!



你根本不知道那有多难熬
You have no idea how bad it gets!



我不是你  我做不到
And I'm not you! I can't make it



一年到山上操一两回就满足全年需求
on a couple of high-altitude fucks once or twice a year!



爱你太艰难了  恩尼斯
You are too much for me, Ennis.



你个臭无赖
You son of a whoreson bitch!



我真希望我知道如何戒掉你
I wish I knew how to quit you!



那你怎么不戒
Then why don't you?



你为什么不让我好好过我的生活
Why don't you just let me be, huh?



全是因为你  杰克  我才变成现在这样
It's because of you, Jack, that I'm like this.



我一无是处
I'm nothing.



我漂泊不定
I'm nowhere.



没事的
It's okay.



给我滚开
Get the fuck off me!



没事的  没事的
It's all right. It's all right.



你个混蛋  恩尼斯
Damn you, Ennis.



我再也受不了了  杰克
I just can't stand this anymore, Jack.



拜托  你像马一样站着睡着了
Come on now, you're sleeping on your feet like a horse.



小时候我妈也总这么说我
My mama used to say that to me when I was little.



还给我唱歌
And sing to me.



我得走了
I got to go.



明早见
See you in the morning.



等一下
Excuse me.



恩尼斯·德·玛尔
Ennis Del Mar.



你这段时间去哪儿了
Where you been?



到处折腾
Here and there.



我让农场的斯蒂夫给你带个信
I left word for you with Steve at the ranch.



而且你肯定收到我留在你家的字条了
And you must've got those notes I left at your place.



看来不管怎样  我还是收到消息了
Looks like I got the message, in any case.



你说卡尔吗
Carl?



没错  卡尔人不错
Yeah, Carl's nice.



他甚至会聊天
He even talks.



那你走运了
Good for you.



是啊
Yeah.



我走运了
Good for me.



我搞不懂你  恩尼斯·德·玛尔
I don't get you, Ennis Del Mar.



对不起
I'm sorry.



反正我这人也没什么乐趣  对吧
I was probably no fun anyways, was I?



恩尼斯  女人不会爱上乐趣
Ennis, girls don't fall in love with fun.

{\an8}{\pos(186.8,23.466)}杰克
不如我们11月7日见
我去松木溪找你
恩尼斯·德·玛尔



{\an8}{\pos(179.2,53.333)}收件人已故



喂
Hello.



喂  我是恩尼斯·德·玛尔
Hello, this is Ennis Del Mar.



谁  你是谁
Who? Who is this?



恩尼斯·德·玛尔  杰克的老朋友
Ennis Del Mar. I'm an old buddy of Jack's.



杰克以前提到过你
Jack used to mention you.



你是他钓鱼或打猎的伴儿  这我知道
You're the fishing buddy or the hunting buddy, I know that.



我本来想通知你的
Would have let you know what happened



但我没有你的名字或地址
but I wasn't sure about your name or address.



杰克把朋友的地址都记在脑子里
Jack kept his friends' addresses in his head.



我打这个电话是想问问  究竟是怎么回事
That's why I'm calling, to see what happened.



杰克当时在小路上
Jack was pumping up a flat on the truck



给卡车的轮胎打气  车胎爆了
out on a back road, when the tire blew up.



车胎的轮圈砸中了他的脸
The rim of the tire slammed into his face,



打断了他的鼻子和下巴
broke his nose and jaw



直接让他倒在地上  失去了意识
and knocked him unconscious on his back.



等有人来时
By the time somebody come along,



他已经被自己的血呛死了
he'd drowned in his own blood.



他才39岁
He was only 39 years old.



喂  还在吗
Hello? Hello?



喂
Hello.



他被埋在那儿了吗
Was he buried down there?



我们立了个碑
We put a stone up.



他被火化了  如他所愿
He was cremated, like he wanted.



他的骨灰一半埋在这里
Half his ashes was interred here,



另一半送回他父母那儿了
the rest was sent up with his folks.



他以前总说想把自己的骨灰
He use to say he wanted his ashes



撒在断背山上
scattered on Brokeback Mountain,



但我不知道那是哪儿
but I wasn't sure where that was.



我猜断背山可能是他从小长大的地方
I thought Brokeback Mountain might be around where he grew up.



我了解杰克
Knowing Jack,



这地方没准是他想像出来的
it might be some pretend place



有鸟儿歌唱  有美酒流淌
where bluebirds sing and there's a whiskey spring.



不  夫人
No, ma'am,



我们63年夏天曾在断背山上放羊
we was herding sheep on Brokeback one summer back in '63.



好吧  他说那是他最爱的地方
Well, he said it was his favorite place.



我以为他指的是去买醉
I thought he meant to get drunk.



他喝酒喝得很凶
He drank a lot.



他父母还在闪平镇吗
Is his folks still up in Lightning Flat?



他们会一直在那里住到死了
They'll be there till the day they die.



耽误你的时间了  谢谢
Thank you for your time.



我真的很遗憾
I sure am sorry.



我们曾是好朋友
We was good friends.



联系下他的父母吧
Get in touch with his folks.



我想如果他的愿望得以实现  他们会很感激的
I suppose they'd appreciate it if his wishes was carried out.



我是说骨灰的事
About the ashes, I mean.



想来杯咖啡吗
Want a cup of coffee, don't you?



来点樱桃蛋糕
Piece of cherry cake?



好的  夫人  咖啡吧
Yes, ma'am, I'll have a cup of coffee



但我现在吃不了蛋糕  谢谢
but I can't eat no cake just now. Thank you.



杰克的事我非常难过
I feel awful bad about Jack.



谢谢
Thank you.



我说不出自己有多难过
I can't begin to tell you how bad I feel.



我认识他很久了
I knew him a long time.



我过来是想说
I come by to say that



如果你们想让我把他的骨灰带去断背山
if you want me to take his ashes up there on Brokeback



他妻子说这是他的愿望
like his wife said he wanted to,



那我很乐意效劳
then I'll be happy to.



我跟你说
I'll tell you what.



我知道断背山在哪儿
I know where Brokeback Mountain is.



他觉得自己太特别
Thought he was too goddamn special



不能埋进家族坟场里
to be buried in the family plot.



杰克以前老是说
Jack used to say...



"恩尼斯·德·玛尔"  他总是这么说
"Ennis Del Mar," He used to say.



"总有一天我要带他来这儿
"I'm gonna bring him up here one of these days"



我们要把这农场打理出个样儿来"
"And we'll lick this damn ranch into shape."
