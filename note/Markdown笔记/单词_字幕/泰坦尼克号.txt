Great.



我是布洛克·洛维特 您有什么事儿吗…？
This is Brock Lovett. How can I help you, Mrs...?



卡尔弗特 她叫露丝·卡尔弗特
Calvert. Rose Calvert.



卡尔弗特夫人
Mrs. Calvert.



我想问问 你是否找到了…
I was just wondering if you had found...



“海洋之心” 洛维特先生
the "Heart of the Ocean" yet, Mr. Lovett.



我跟你说过了 这电话一定想接
Told you you wanted to take the call.

All right, you have my attention, Rose.



你能不能告诉我们 这画上的女人是谁？
Can you tell us who the woman in the picture is?



当然了 这画上的女人就是我
Oh, yes. The woman in the picture is me.



她他妈的就是个骗子！就是个想发财想出名的疯子

God only knows why. Like that Russian babe,



他们来了！

露丝·德维特·布卡特在十七岁时死在了泰坦尼克号上 对吧？
Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the



- 对  - 如果她还活着 现在得有一百岁了
- That's right.  - If she had lived, she'd be



下个月一百零一岁
101 next month.



好吧 那她是个一脸皱纹的骗子
Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar.



听着 我已经查过这女人的底细了…
Look, I've already done the background on this woman...



追溯到二十年代 她那时还是个演员
all the way back to the 20s, when she was working as an



一个演员 这是你的第一个线索 大侦探
An actress. There's your first clue, Sherlock.



她那时叫露丝·道森 后来嫁给了一个叫卡尔弗特的家伙
Her name was Rose Dawson back then.



他们搬到了爱荷华州的拉皮兹 生了几个孩子
They move to Cedar Rapids and she punches out a



我听说卡尔弗特死了 她也离开了那个城市
Now Calvert's dead and, from what I hear, Cedar



知道那颗钻石的人不是去世了…
And everybody who knows about the diamond is supposed to



就是遇难了 但她知道
or on this boat, but she knows.



她出个门的行李可不少啊 是吧？
Doesn't exactly travel light, does she?



快点 帮一下

卡尔弗特夫人 我是布洛克·洛维特 欢迎来到凯尔戴什号

Thanks.



嗨！
Hey!



你们的房间还可以吗？
Are your staterooms all right?



嗯 不错
Oh, yes.



非常好
Very nice.



你见过我孙女利齐了吗？
Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy?



她把我照顾得很好
She takes care of me.



我们几分钟前见过
We met just a few minutes ago.



记得吗 奶奶？在甲板上？
Remember, Nana? Up on deck?



是啊
Oh, yes.



嗯 真好
There. That's nice.



我出门都得带上这些照片
Have to have my pictures when I travel.



我能帮您些什么吗？
Can I get you anything?



有什么是您想要的？
Is there anything you'd like?



是的
Yes.



我想要看看我的画
I would like to see my drawing.



路易十六曾经带着那块宝石…
Louis XVI wore a fabulous stone that was...



它叫做王冠蓝钻…
called the Blue Diamond of the Crown...



消失于一七九二年法国大革命期间…
which disappeared in 1792...



同时路易也被送上断头台
about the same time old Louis lost everything from the neck up.



据说那颗王冠宝石也被做了切割
The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped, too.



被重新切成心的形状 也就是人们熟知的…
Recut into a heart-like shape that became known



海洋之心
the Heart of the Ocean.



时至今日 它的价值已超过“希望钻”
Today it would be worth more than the Hope diamond.



它很重 让人敬畏
It was a dreadful, heavy thing.



我只带过一次
I only wore it this once.



你真的认为这是你吗 奶奶？
You actually think this is you, Nana?



这就是我 亲爱的
It is me, dear.



我那时看起来挺诱人吧？
Wasn't I a dish?



我查遍了相关的保险纪录
I tracked it down through insurance records.



发现了一份严格保密的理赔申请
An old claim that was settled under terms of absolute



露丝 你能告诉我索赔的人是谁吗？
Can you tell me who the claimant was, Rose?



我想应该是个姓霍克利的人
I should imagine someone named Hockley.



内森·霍克利 没错
Nathan Hockley, that's right.



匹兹堡钢铁大亨
Pittsburgh steel tycoon.



索赔是为了一条他儿子卡利登…
The claim was for a diamond necklace his son...



买给未婚妻的钻石项链
Caledon, bought his fiancee.



也就是你
You.



这是在他登上泰坦尼克号一周之前
A week before he sailed on Titanic.



理赔在船沉了后立刻执行了
And it was filed right after the sinking.



所以钻石一定也随着船沉没海底了
So the diamond had to have gone down with the ship.



看到这个日期了吗？
You see the date?



一九一二年四月十四日
April 14, 1912.



也就是说 如果你奶奶说的是真的…
Which means if your grandmother is who she says she



在沉船那天 她就戴着那颗钻石
she was wearing the diamond the day the Titanic sank.



于是你就成了我的好朋友
And that makes you my new best friend.



这些是我们在你房间找到的东西
These are some of the things we recovered from your



这是我的
This was mine.



太不可思议了
How extraordinary.



和我上次见到的一模一样
And it looks the same as it did the last time I saw it.



好吧 镜子里的人有点变化
The reflection has changed a bit.



你准备好重返泰坦尼克了吗？
Are you ready to go back to Titanic?



好 我们开始
Okay, here we go.



船的右舷撞到了冰山 对吧？
She hits the berg on the starboard side, right?



一路碰过去…
She kind of bumps along...



像敲摩斯电码一样撞着…
punching holes like morse code...



嘀嘀嘀… 这样撞着…
dit-dit-dit... along the side...



撞在吃水线下面
below the water line.



然后海水倒灌进前面的客舱
Then the forward compartments start to flood.



随着水位上升…
Now, as the water level rises...



水流过水密藏的挡板…
it spills over the watertight bulkheads...



很不幸 这挡板只达到E层甲板
which, unfortunately, don't go any higher than E deck.



所以船头开始下沉…
So now as the bow goes down...



船尾慢慢升高…
the stern rises up, slow at first...



然后越来越快…
then faster and faster...



直到最后 船尾翘在空中
until finally, she's got her whole ass sticking up in the air.



那船尾可大得很
And that's a big ass.



有两三万吨中 知道吧？
We're talking 20, 30,000 tons. Okay?



船龙骨的设计不足以承受这种压力
And the hull's not designed to deal with that pressure.



所以 怎么样了呢？
So, what happens?



船解体了 龙骨断裂
She splits, right down to the keel.



船尾…
And the stern...



又回到了水平位置
falls back level.



然后…
Then...



随着船头下沉…
as the bow sinks...



它不断拉着船尾 船尾又垂直于海面…
it pulls the stern vertical...



最后船尾和船身分离
and then finally detaches.



随后船尾像软木塞一样 在海面漂浮了几分钟…
Now the stern section just kind of bobs there



海水不断涌入 在撞击冰山两小时四十分之后…
floods, and finally goes under about 2:20



于凌晨两点二十分沉没
2 hours and 40 minutes after the collision.



船头坠向海底…
The bow section planes away...



下坠约半英里…
landing about a half a mile away...



以二三十节的速度撞击海床
going 20, 30 knots when it hits the ocean floor.



很酷吧 嗯？
Pretty cool, huh?



博丁先生 感谢您生动的分析
Thank you for that fine forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.



当然了 亲身的经历…
Of course, the experience of it was...



还是有些不同
somewhat different.



您愿意和我们分享吗？
Will you share it with us?



我带她休息一下
I'm taking her to rest.



不
No.



来吧 奶奶
Come on, Nana.



不！
No!



把录音机给我
Give me the tape recorder.



露丝 告诉我们
Tell us, Rose.



八十四年了…
It's been 84 years...



没关系 试着想想…
It's okay. Just try to remember anything...



什么事都行
anything at all.



洛维特先生 你想不想听这个？
Do you want to hear this or not, Mr. Lovett?



八十四年了…
It's been 84 years...



我仍然可以闻到新刷的油漆
and I can still smell the fresh paint.



从未用过的瓷器
The china had never been used.



从没睡过的床单
The sheets had never been slept in.



泰坦尼克被称为梦幻之船
Titanic was called the ship of dreams.



确实如此
And it was.



它的确是
It really was.



所有三等舱的乘客…
All third-class passengers...



船头铺位的…
with a forward berth...



请这边走！这里排队！
this way please! This queue!



这船真大啊 是吗？
It's a big boat, huh?



爸爸 这是个大船
Daddy, it's a ship.



你说得没错
You're right.



我不知道人们在大惊小怪什么
I don't see what all the fuss is about.



这看着不比毛里塔尼亚号大多少啊
It doesn't look any bigger than the Mauretania.



露丝 你别的可以看不上…
You can be blase about some things, Rose...



但泰坦尼克号可不一样
but not about Titanic.



它比毛里塔尼亚号要长一百英尺…
It's over 100 feet longer than Mauretania...



并且要豪华得多
and far more luxurious.



鲁思 取悦您女儿可真难
Your daughter is far too difficult to impress, Ruth.



这就是人们说的不沉之船
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.



它确实不会沉
It is unsinkable.



就算上帝本人也没法弄沉它…
God Himself could not sink this ship...



什么？！
What?!



您得到集散站去托运行李
You have to check your baggage through the main terminal.



先生 就在那边
It's round that way, sir.



先生 我相信你的能力
I put my faith in you good sir.



我的人会和你交代
Now kindly see my man.



好的 先生 这是我的荣幸
Yes sir. It's my pleasure, sir.



您随便吩咐…
If I can do anything at all...

Yes, right.

All the trunks from that car there.

12 from here.



还有保险箱 都搬到套房里…
And the safe, to the parlor suite...



房间号B五二 五四 五六
rooms B52, 54, 56.

Ladies...

we better hurry.

所有三等舱乘客到这里排队体检
All third-class passengers queue here for health



- 夫人 欢迎登船  - 欢迎乘坐泰坦尼克号
- Welcome aboard, ma'am.  - Welcome to Titanic.



对所有人来说…
It was the ship of dreams...



这是艘梦幻之船
to everyone else.



但于我 却是奴隶之船…
To me. It was a slave ship...



用枷锁 把我押回美国
taking me back to America in chains.



表面上看 我是个名门淑女
Outwardly, I was everything a well brought up girl should be.



实际上 我内心在嘶吼
Inside, I was screaming.



杰克 你是个疯子
Jack, you are pazzo.



你把我们所有东西都赌上了
You bet everything we have.



当你一无所有 也就没什么可以失去
When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose.



你个白痴 真不敢相信你堵上了我们的船票
You moron. I can't believe you bet our tickets.

Forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough



事实上只能容纳一半的乘客
About half, actually.



露丝 真是什么都瞒不过你
Rose, you miss nothing, do you?



事实上 我提出用这些新式的吊艇柱…
In fact, I put in these new type davits...

迟早会燃烧殆尽的
that fire is gonna burn out.



这不是你能决定的 杰克
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.

露丝要定淡紫色的礼服
Rose decided she wanted lavender.



她知道我不喜欢那个颜色
She knows I detest the color.



所以她才故意气我
So, she did it only to spite me.



你早就该来找我了
If only you'd come to me sooner.



鲁思在杂志上看到过我设计的礼服

抱歉… 可他置之不理 甚至还下令加速前进

他航行了二十六年 犯了经验主义的错误
26 years of experience working against him.



他认为能够让这艘船沉没的东西…

都能及时被发现 然后可以迅速转向
they're gonna see in time to turn.



但是船的惯性太大了 船舵不过够大
But the ship's too big with too small a rudder.



根本来不及转向
Doesn't corner worth a damn.



他的判断完全错误
Everything he knows is wrong.



这里比较合适 这是起居室
It's quite proper, I assure you. This is the sitting room.

艺术家不是对光线要求很严么？
Don't artists need good light?



没错 但我不太习惯…
That is true, but I'm not used to working in...



在这种环境作画
such horrible conditions.



莫尼特！
Monet!



- 你看过他的作品吗？ - 当然了
- Do you know his work?  - Of course.

I know. It's extraordinary.



卡尔到那里都得带着这东西
Cal insists on carting this hideous thing everywhere.

大艺术家 你的脸红了

那是我这辈子最活色生香的时刻了…
It was the most erotic moment of my life...

帮我把这个放回保险箱好吗？

反而会更难发现冰山
with no breaking water at the base.

Well, I'm off.



莱特勒先生 保持全速前进
Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.



是 船长

但这是我的直觉
That's why I trust it.

Here, look at this.



看到没？
Look at that, would you?
