恐惧 背叛 嗜血
Fear. Treachery. Bloodlust.



几千年前...
Thousands of years ago...



这些力量统治着我们的世界
these were the forces that ruled our world.



那时候食草动物惧怕食肉动物
A world where prey were scared of predators.



食肉动物们也根本无法控制自己...
And predators had an uncontrollable...



天性中...
biological urge...



伤害 攻击的冲动...
to maim, and maul, and...



血! 血! 血!
Blood! Blood! Blood!



然后死亡
And death.



在当时 世界分为两个阵营
Back then, the world was divided in two.



凶恶的食肉动物...
Vicious predator...



和温顺的食草动物
or meek prey.



{\an4}凶恶的食肉动物



{\an6}温顺的食草动物



但随着历史的发展 我们进化了
But over time, we evolved.



我们抛弃了原始 残忍的习性
And moved beyond our primitive, savage ways.



现在 食肉动物和食草动物和谐共处
Now, predator and prey live in harmony.



每一只年轻的哺乳动物都有无限的可能性
And every young mammal has multitudinous opportunities.



是啊
Yeah.



一身黑毛的我不用再躲在羊群里了
I don't have to cower in a herd anymore.



我可以成为一名宇航员
Instead, I can be an astronaut.



我不需要再独自去捕猎了
I don't have to be a lonely hunter anymore.



现在 我可以追捕逃税的人
Today, I can hunt for tax exemptions.



我要成为一位精算师!
I'm gonna be an actuary!



而我可以让世界变得更好
And I can make the world a better place.



我要成为...
I am going to be...



一名警察!
a police officer!



兔子警察?
Bunny cop?



这是我听过的最傻的事了
That is the most stupidest thing I ever heard.



也许有些目光短浅的人觉得这不太可能...
It may seem impossible to small minds...



我说你呢 吉迪恩·格雷
I'm looking at you, Gideon Grey.



但是 在211英里外的地方...
But, just 211 miles away...



有一座叫动物城的伟大城市!
stands the great city of Zootopia!



我们的祖先们在那里开启了和平共处的新篇章...
Where our ancestors first joined together in peace...



他们宣称一切皆有可能!
and declared that anyone can be anything!



谢谢大家 晚安!
Thank you and good night!



朱迪 你有想过我和你妈妈...
Judy, you ever wonder how your mom and me...



为什么那么快乐吗?
gotto be so darn happy?



没有
Nope.



因为我们放弃梦想 安定了下来 对吧 邦妮?
Well, we gave up on our dreams and we settled. Right, Bon?



是啊 说得好 斯图 我们特别安定
Oh, yes, that's right, Stu. We settled hard.



看到了吧 这就是知足常乐 朱迪
See, that's the beauty of complacency, Jude.



不去尝试什么新东西 就永远不会失败
If you don't try anything new, you'll never fail.



我喜欢尝试新东西
I like trying actually.



宝贝 你爸爸想说的是...
What you father means, hon...



成为一个警察对你来说...
is it's gonna be difficult...



是很难的 甚至是不可能的
impossible even, for you to become a police officer.



是啊 历史上从来没有过兔子警察
Right. There's never been a bunny cop.



- 没听说过  - 兔子不是当警察的料
- No.  - Bunnies don't do that.



- 没错  - 绝对不是
- Never.  - Never.



是吗 那我就得做第一个了
Oh. Then, I guess I'll have to be the first one.



因为我要...
Because I am gonna make...



让世界变得更好
the world a better place.



或者 其实 你如果想...
Or, uh, heck, you know, you want to talk...



让世界变得更好...
about making the world a better place...



最好的方式就是做一个种胡萝卜的农夫了
no better way to do it than becoming a carrot farmer.



就是啊! 你爸爸和我...
Yes! Your dad, me...



还有你的275个兄弟姐妹们
your 275 brothers and sisters.



- 我们在改变世界!  - 是啊
- We're changing the world!  - Yeah.



- 一步一个胡萝卜  - 可不是吗
- One carrot at a time.  - Amen to that.



种胡萝卜是个高尚的工作
Carrot farming is a noble profession.



嗯
Mmm-hmm.



只要把种子播撒在土地上
Just putting the seeds in the ground.



啊 要照看土壤 弄得全身都是泥
Ah, at one with the soil. Just getting covered in dirt.



就是这样 亲爱的
You get it, honey.



有梦想是好事
It's great to have dreams.



没错 就是别太执迷不悟
Yeah. Just as long as you don't believe in them too much.



她溜到哪里去了?
Where'd the heck she go?



把你们的票子给我...
Give me your tickets right now...



- 否则我踢爆你那温顺的羊屁股  - 啊!
- or I'm gonna kick your meek little sheep butt.  - Ow!



别闹了 吉迪恩!
Cut it out, Gideon!



咩! 咩! 你打算怎么办呢? 哭吗?
Baa! Baa! What are you gonna do? Cry?



嘿! 她说了 别闹了
Hey! You heard her. Cut it out.



戏服不错嘛 废物点心
Nice costume, loser.



你是不是脑子搭错了...
What crazy world are you living in...



竟然以为兔子可以成为警察?
where you think a bunny could be a cop?



请把我朋友们的票子还给他们
Kindly return my friend's tickets.



你来拿啊
Come and get them.



不过你得小心点 我可是一只狐狸...
But watch out, because I'm a fox...



你在那个傻乎乎的舞台剧里都说了...
and like you said in your dumb little stage play...



我们这些食肉动物以前可是会吃你们的
us predators used to eat prey.



这种杀手的本能还留在我们的基心里呢
And that killer instinct is still in our Dunnah.



呃 那个词应该读"基因"吧
Uh, I'm pretty much sure it's pronounced "DNA."



我知道 特拉维斯 用不着你告诉我
Don't tell me what I know, Travis.



我才不怕你呢 吉迪恩
You don't scare me, Gideon.



你现在害怕了吧?
You scared now?



看她那鼻子一抽一抽的!
Look at her nose twitch!



她害怕了!
She is scared!



哭吧小兔子
Cry little baby bunny.



哭吧 哭吧...
Cry, cry...



你真是不放弃啊 是吧?
Oh, you don't know when to quit, do you?



我要你记住这个时刻...
I want you to remember this moment...



下回再也别以为...
the next time you think...



你除了做一只笨笨的 种萝卜的傻兔子...
you will ever be anything more than just a stupid...



还能干什么别的事情
carrot-farming, dumb bunny.



伤口好严重
That looks bad.



你还好吗 朱迪?
Are you okay, Judy?



嗯 我没事
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.



- 给你  - 哦!
- Here you go.  - Oh!



哇! 你把我们的票子拿回来了!
Wow! You got our tickets!



你太厉害了 朱迪!
You're awesome, Judy!



是啊 那个吉迪恩·格雷都是在胡说八道
Yeah, that Gideon Grey doesn't know what he's talking about.



他有一句话倒是说对了
Well, he was right about one thing.



我不会放弃
I don't know when to quit.

with their cookies and cream?



你胡说什么?
What are you talking about?



其实 我也不想给你找麻烦...
Well, I don't want to cause you any trouble...



但是用未带鼻套的鼻子...
but I believe scooping ice cream...



盛冰激凌 算得上是...
with an ungloved trunk is a Class 3...



食品卫生法三级违规了
health code violation.



这可不是小事
Which is kind of a big deal.



当然 我可以仅仅对你们提出警告...
Of course, I could let you off with a warning...



只要你们以后都戴上鼻套 并且...

You know, it burns me up to see folks...



对狐狸有这么深的偏见
with such backward attitudes toward foxes.



我只想说 你是个特别好的爸爸
I just wanna say you're a great dad and just a...



口才也很棒
a real articulate fella.



哇 这评价可太高了
Oh, well, that is high praise.



很少见到像您这么平易近人的人
It's rare that I find someone so non-patronizing.



请问您叫...
Officer...

就因为他是只树懒...

It's registered to Tundratown Limo Service.



水獭被豪车带走了! 车在冰川镇!
A limo took Otterton, and the limo's in Tundratown!



冰川镇!
It's in Tundratown!



干的不错 伙计 我爱你 欠你个人情
Way to hustle, bud. I love you. I owe you.



快点! 我们要赶在晚高峰前...
Hurry! We gotta beat the rush hour, and...



已经是晚上了?
It's night?



关门了 这下倒好
Closed. Great.



{\an8}冰川镇豪车服务中心



嗯 我敢打赌
Mmm. And I wI'll bet you...



你身上没有搜查令 对吧?
you don't have a warrant to get in. Hmm?



运气真背 麻烦大了
Darn it. It's a bummer.



你故意浪费我的时间
You wasted the day on purpose.



长官 我是个假警察
Madam, I have a fake badge.



我绝不会干扰你装模作样的调查
I would never impede your pretend investigation.



这不是装模作样的调查 你看到没?
It's not a pretend investigation. Look, see?



看看他 这只水獭前不久失踪了
See him? This otter is missing.



那就该派一个货真价实的警察去找咯
Well, then they should've gotten a real cop to find him.



你是什么毛病?
What is your problem?



看到我失败就能让你对自己
Does seeing me fail somehow make you feel better...



悲惨的人生感到欣慰吗?
about your own sad, miserable life?



我感到特别欣慰
It does 100%.



现在 既然你没有搜查令...
Now, since you're sans warrant...



那我们就完事了吧?
I guess we're... done?



好 完事了 你的笔
Fine. We are done. Here's your pen.



嘿!
Hey!



首先 姿势真丑
First off, you throw like a bunny.



其次 你可真够输不起的
Second, you're a very sore loser.



回见啦 毛毛球警官
See you later, Officer Fluff.



真遗憾 我本来还想多帮帮你呢
So sad this is over. I wish I could've helped more.



问题是 有正当理由的情况下不需要搜查证
The thing is, you don't need a warrant if you have probable cause...



而我刚刚看见一只形迹可疑的狐狸爬过围栏
and I'm pretty sure I saw a shifty lowlife climbing the fence.



你确实帮了我很多哟 来吧
So you're helping plenty. Come on.



29THD03 就是它!
2- 9- T- H- D- O- 3. This is it!



北极熊的毛
Polar bear fur.



- 哦 天啊!  - 怎么了?
- Oh, my God!  - What? What?



鼠杰瑞的个人专辑
The Velvety Pipes of Jerry Vole.



可惜是CD
But on CD.



这年头谁还用CD?
Who still uses CDs?



小萝卜头 如果水獭真的来过这儿
Carrots, if your otter was here...



它估计受了点苦头
he had a very bad day.

Those are claw marks.



你见过这种场面吗?
You ever seen anything like this?

This is him, Emmitt Otterton.



他肯定来过这儿

为什么? 这车是谁的?
Why? Whose car is it?



他可是冰川镇最可怕的黑帮老大
The most feared crime- boss in Tundratown.



人称大先生
They call him Mr. Big.



他不怎么喜欢我 我们得赶紧走!
And he does not like me. So we gotta go!



我才不走 这可是犯罪现场
I'm not leaving. This is a crime scene.



如果大先生发现我在这里...
Well, it's gonna be an even bigger crime scene...



这车就会变成更糟的犯罪现场了
if Mr. Big finds me here...



所以我们得赶紧撤
so we're leaving right now.



雷蒙德!
Raymond!



还有凯文? 好久不见啊
And is that Kevin? Long time, no see.



既然"好久没见"了
And, speaking of "no see"...



看在老朋友的份上
how about you forget you saw me, huh?



您就当没看见我?
For old times' sake?



看来没戏
That's a no.



你到底做了什么...
What did you do that made...



让大先生这么生气?
Mr. Big so mad at you?



大概是... 我卖给他一条价值不菲的羊毛地毯
I, uh, I may have sold him a very expensive wool rug...



但其实原料不是羊毛 而是臭鼬...
that was made from the fur of a skunk...



的屁股
...'s butt.



我滴个乖乖哦
Oh, sweet cheese and crackers.



那是大先生吗?
Is that Mr. Big?



不是
No.



那他呢?
What about him?



- 是他吗?  - 不是!
- Is that him?  - No!



那一定是他了
That's got to be him.



闭上嘴 别说话 别说了!
Stop talking, stop talking, stop talking!



- 嗯  - 大先生
- Huh.  - Mr. Big, sir.



这只是一个小小的...
This is a simple...



来...
Yeah. Here...



只是一个小小的误会
This is a simple misunderstanding.



今天是我女儿大喜的日子
You come here, unannounced...



你竟然也敢不请自来
on the day my daughter is to be married.



嗯 事实上 我们是...
Well, actually, we were brought here...



被强行带到这里来的
against ourwill, so...



重点是 我并不知道那是您的车
The point is, I did not know that it was your car...



我也完全不知道今天是您女儿的婚礼
and I certainly did not know about your daughter's wedding.



小尼克 我相信过你
I trusted you, Nicky.



我邀请你来我家
I welcomed you into my home.



我请你吃饭
We broke bread together.



我奶奶还为你做了奶油甜馅煎饼卷
Gram-mama made you a cannoli.



但你是怎么报答我的?
And how did you repay my generosity?



卖给我一条 用臭鼬屁股做的地毯
With a rug made from the butt of a skunk.



臭鼬臀毛毯
A skunk-butt rug.



你羞辱了我
You disrespected me.



你羞辱了我的奶奶
You disrespected my Gram-mama...



我用那条地毯埋葬了我奶奶
who I buried in that skunk butt rug.



我警告过你 不要再出现在这里
I told you never to show your face here again...



但你还是来了...
but here you are...



鬼头鬼脸的 还带了...
snooping around with this...



你是干嘛的? 演员吗?
What are you? A performer?



干嘛穿着制服?
What's with the costume?



先生 我是...
Sir. I am a...



哑剧演员! 她是个哑剧演员
Mime! She is a mime.



不能说话的哑剧演员
This... mime cannot speak.



哑剧演员 不能说话
You can't speak if you're a mime.



不 我是个警察
No, I am a cop.



我是来调查埃米特·奥獭顿的案子
And I'm on the Emmitt Otterton case.



证据显示他上过你的车
And my evidence puts him in your car.



所以你只管尽情的恐吓我
So intimidate me all you want,



但在查明真相之前...
I'm going to find out what you did to that otter...



我绝不善罢甘休
if it's the last thing I do.



那我就只有一个要求了
Then I have only one request.



代我向奶奶问好 冰了他们
Say hello to Gram-mama. Ice 'em.



我什么都没看见! 我什么都不会说的!
I didn't see nothing! I'm not saying nothing!



确实再也不会了
And you never will.



- 拜托! 不要 不要!  - 放我下来!
- Please! No, no, no!  - Put me down!



您要是对毯子不满意 我还有很多毯子!
If you're mad at me about the rug, I've got more rugs!



爸爸! 该跳舞了!
Oh, Daddy! It's time for our dance!



你之前答应过我什么?
Oh, what did we say?



在我的婚礼上不冰人!
No icing anyone at my wedding!



宝贝 没办法 爸爸也很无奈

她就是昨天救我一命的兔警官!

Hi. I love your dress.

You've done me a great service.



我会帮你找到水獭
I wI'll help you find the otter.



我会收下你的善意 以德报德
I will take your kindness and pay it forward.



奥獭顿是我的花匠
Otterton is my florist.



他就像我的家人一样
He's like a part of the family.



当时他说有重要的事情要跟我商量
He had something important he wanted to discuss.



所以我就派了一辆车去接他
That's why I sent that car to pick him up.



但是他没来
But he never arrived.



因为他受到了袭击?
Because he was attacked?



不 是他袭击了别人
No. He attacked.



你说奥獭顿?
Otterton?



就是奥獭顿 他当时像发疯了似的
Otterton. He went crazy.



砸毁了我的车 还把我的司机吓得半死
Ripped up the car, scared my driver half to death...



然后消失在黑夜中
and disappeared into the night.



可他是生性温和的水獭啊
But he's a sweet little otter.



亲爱的 我们是进化了 但是骨子里...
Hmm. My child, we may be evolved, but deep down...



我们仍旧是动物
we are still animals.



你要是想找奥獭顿
You want to find Otterton,



不妨找我的司机去谈谈吧
talk to the driver of that car.



他叫曼查斯
His name is Manchas.



住在雨林区那边
lives in the Rain forest District.



他会告诉你更多的信息
Only he can tell you more.



曼查斯先生?
Mr. Manchas?



我是动物城警局的朱迪·霍普斯
Judy Hopps, ZPD.



我们想向您打听一下埃米特·奥獭顿的遭遇
We just wanna know what happened to Emmitt Otterton.



你们...
You...



该调查的是...
should be asking...



- 我的遭遇  -  哇!
- what happened to me. - Whoa!



是那个水獭干的么?
Uh, a teensy otter did that?



究竟发生了什么?
What happened?



他就是一头野兽
He was an animal.



俯身
Down...



四脚着地
on all fours.



他就是头野兽!
He was a savage!



当时毫无征兆
There was no warning.



他只是不停喊着"午夜嚎叫"
He just kept yelling about the Night Howlers.



一遍又一遍 "午夜嚎叫"
Over and over. The Night Howlers.



这么说 你也知道午夜嚎叫 是吗?
So you know about the Night Howlers, too?



好 非常好
Good. Good, good.



因为我们来找你...
Because the Night Howlers...



就是想谈一谈这个午夜嚎叫
are exactly what we are here to talk about.



- 对吧?  - 是的
- Right?  - Yup.



所以 只要你打开门
So, uh, so you just open the door...



把你知道的告诉我们
and tell us what you know...



我们也会把我们知道的告诉你 好吗?
and we will tell you what we know. Okay?



好的
Okay.



聪明的狐狸
Clever fox.



曼查斯先生?
Mr. Manchas?



哥们儿?
Buddy?



你还...
Are you...



好吗?

跑 快跑!
Run. Run!



他怎么了?
What is wrong with him?



我怎么知道!
I don't know!



快跳!
Jump!



快!
Come on!



低头!
Head down!



朱迪警官呼叫总部
Officer Hopps to Dispatch.



你知道夏奇羊吧 就是那个
Are you familiar with Gazelle, greatest singer



长角羊 当红歌手?
of our lifetime, angel with horns?



好的 别急 继续看
Okay, hold on. Keep watching.



瞧 在她身边的是谁? 他是谁?
Who's that beside her? Who is it?



哇哦 你真是个舞林高手 爪豪泽
Wow, you are one hot dancer, Benjamin Clawhauser.



没错 就是我! 看起来像真的吗?
It's me! Did you think it was real?



特别像是真的!
It looks so real!



其实不是 这只是一个新的App 稍等一下
It's not, it's just a new app. Hold on a second.



爪豪泽!
Clawhauser!



爪豪泽 听我说 发生了紧急事件!
Clawhauser, listen to me, we have a 10-91!



一只美洲豹发疯了!

兄弟
Buddy.



本是同根生 相煎...
One predator to another...



别 别 别 ...
No, no, no...



我跟你说 你情绪太过激动了
Now, I can tell you're a little tense...



但是没有关系 我会给你一点私人空间!
so I'm just gonna give you a little personal space! Ah!



兔子 不管怎样 千万不要松手!
Rabbit, whatever you do, do not let go!



- 我要松手了!  - 不 你 什么?
- I'm gonna let go!  - No, you, what?



- 一 二...  - 不...
- One, two...  - No...



我说不要... 兔子!
I said, do not... Rabbit!



小萝卜头 你救了我的命
Carrots. You saved my life.



我们动物城警局就是干这行的
Well. That's what we do at the ZPD.



我们来听听有什么好消息
Well, this should be good.



我本以为这只是一起哺乳动物失踪案...
I thought this was just a missing mammal case...



但其实它严重多了
but it's way bigger.



奥獭顿先生不仅失踪了
Mr. Otterton did not just disappear.



我认为他和这只美洲豹都野蛮化了
I believe he and this jaguar, they went savage, sir.



野蛮化? 现在不是石器时代了 霍普斯
Savage? This isn't the Stone Age, Hopps.



动物不会再 "野蛮化" 了
Animals don't "go savage."



我之前也这么想 直到我看见这个
I thought so, too, until I saw this.



怎么回事? 他刚才还在这的
What? He was right here.



那只 "野蛮化" 的美洲豹?
The "savage" jaguar?



长官 我亲眼所见 他差点杀了我们!
Sir, I know what I saw. He almost killed us!



也许 任何凶猛的食肉动物...
Or, maybe any aggressive predator...



在你们兔子眼里都是野蛮的
looks savage to you rabbits.



走吧!
Let's go!



等等 长官
Wait, sir.



我不是唯一的目击者
I'm not the only one who saw him.



尼克!
Nick!



你觉得我会相信一只狐狸说的话?
You think I'm gonna believe a fox?



但他是关键目击证人 而且我...
Well, he was a key witness, and I...



两天之内找到水獭...
Two days to find the otter...



否则你就辞职
or you quit.



你答应过的
That was the deal.



把徽章给我
Badge.



- 但是 长官 我们....  - 徽章! 
- But, sir, we...  - Badge!



不行
Uh, no.



狐狸 你刚才说什么?
What did you say, fox?



抱歉 我说的是 "不行"
Sorry. What I said was, "no"



她不会把徽章给你的
She will not be giving you that badge.



你分给她一件丑背心儿...
Look, you give her a clown vest...



一辆可笑的三轮电动车...
and a three... wheeled joke... mobile...



只给了两天时间...
and two days to solve a case...



去破一件你们两周都没破的案子?
you guys haven't cracked in two weeks?



可不是嘛
Yeah.



难怪她要来找狐狸帮忙
It's no wonder she needed to get help from a fox.



你们没人准备帮她 对吧?
None of you guys were gonna help her, were you?



- 等...  - 是这么回事 警长
- Ho...   - Here's the thing, Chief.



你给了她48小时
You gave her the 48 hours...



所以 准确来说 我们还剩...
so, technically, we still have...



10小时来寻找我们的奥獭顿先生...
10 left to find our Mr. Otterton...



而且我们一定会找到他
and that is exactly what we're gonna do.



所以 失陪啦...
So, if you'll excuse us...



我们还有大线索要追 案子要破呢
we have a very big lead to follow and a case to crack.



祝你愉快
Good day.



霍普斯警官
Officer Hopps.



谢谢你
Thank you.



别让他们知道自己能打击到你
Never let them see that they get to you.



这么说...
So...



你也会受打击?
things do get to you?



不 我是说 我现在不会了...
No, I mean, not anymore...



但是我以前又弱小...
but I was small...



又敏感脆弱 就像你一样
and emotionally unbalanced like you once.



真好笑啊
Hahar.



不 是真的
No, it's true.



在我8岁 也许9岁的时候
I think I was 8, or maybe 9...



我一心只想...
and all I wanted to do...



加入少年童子军团
was join the Junior Ranger Scouts.



所以 我妈妈东拼西凑攒够了钱...
So, my mom scraped together enough money...



给我买了一件崭新的制服...
to buy me a brand new uniform...



因为 我终于要融入集体啦
because, by God, I was gonna fit in.



即使我是队伍里唯一的食肉动物
Even if I was the only predator in the troop.



唯一一只狐狸
The only fox.



好了 尼克
Okay, Nick.



我也能成为童子军团的一员
I was gonna be part of a pack.



准备好入团仪式了吗?
Ready for initiation?



当然 简直生来就准备好啦
Yeah. Pretty much born ready.



我是那么的骄傲
I was so proud.



好了
Okay.



举起你的右爪 开始宣示
Now, raise your right paw and deliver the oath.



我 尼古拉斯·王尔德 发誓将会勇敢... 
I, Nicholas Wilde, promise to be brave...



忠诚 乐于助人 并且值得信任
loyal, helpful, and trustworthy.



哪怕你是一只狐狸?
Even though you're a fox?



什么?
What?



不要 不要! 我做错了什么?
No. No! What did I do wrong, you guys?



不要 求你们! 告诉我! 我做错什么了?
No, please! Tell me! What did I do wrong?



我做错什么了?
What did I do?



不...
No...



你居然以为我们会相信一只...
If you thought we would ever trust a fox...



没带口套的狐狸...
without a muzzle...



你比你看起来的样子要蠢多了!
you're even dumber than you look!



爱哭鬼
Cry baby.



哎呦 他要哭了吗?
Aw, is he gonna cry?



那天我学会了两件事
I learned two things that day.



第一件...
One..



我不会让任何人知道他们能打击到我
I was never gonna let anyone see that they got to me.



第二件呢?
And two?



如果整个世界都只认为狐狸...
If the world's only gonna see a fox...



是狡猾不可信的...
as shifty and untrustworthy...



那就没有什么必要去改变我们的形象了
there's no point in trying to be anything else.



尼克 你的品质远不止那些
Nick, you are so much more than that.



天啊 瞧下面堵得多厉害啊
Boy, look at that traffic down there.



不如我们去问问交通中心的查克
How about we go out to Chuck in Traffic Central.



查克 道路监控显示的路况如何啦?
Chuck, how are things looking on the Jam Cams?



尼克 你能告诉我这些事 我很感动
Nick, I'm glad you told me.



道路监控
The Jam Cams.



- 真的 你不用不好意思  - 不不不
- Seriously. It's okay.  - No, no, no.



道路监控摄像头遍布各个角落!
There are traffic cameras everywhere!



每棵树冠下都有!
All over the canopy!



无论那只美洲豹遭遇了什么...
Whatever happened to that jaguar...



摄像头都拍下来了!
The traffic cams would have caught it!



- 正确!  - 嚯 嚯!
- Bingo!  - Ho ho!



很聪明嘛 小滑头!
Pretty sneaky, slick!



但是 假如你之前进不去系统的话...
However, if you didn't have access to the system before...



牛屁股警官现在也不会让你进入
I doubt Chief Buffalo Butt is gonna let you into it now.



确实
No.



但我在市政厅有个朋友 她也许能搞定
But I have a friend at City Hall who might.



先生 拜托您看一下这些重要文...
Sir, if we could just review these very important...



先生...
Sir...



非常抱歉 先生!
I'm so sorry. Sir!



行了 我听到了 羊副市长 你搞定就行了
Okay. I heard you, Bellwether. Just take care of it.



拜托 还有取消下午的事项 我要出门
Please. And clear my afternoon. I'm going out.



不行! 先生 你下午还有个...
No, no! But, sir, you do have a meeting...



和牧草集团的会议呢
with Herds and Grazing.



先生 我能先...
Sir, if I could just...



唉 梅林的羊排啊
Oh, mutton chops.



羊副市长?
Assistant Mayor Bellwether?



我们需要你的帮助
We need your help.



我们只需要进入道路监控系统的数据库
We just need to get into the traffic cam database.



好松软啊!
So fluffy!



嘿!
Hey!



绵羊们从来不让我靠他们这么近
Sheep never let me get this close.



你不可以直接这样摸羊毛!
You can't just touch a sheep's wool!



像棉花糖一样
It's like cotton candy.



住手!
Stop it!



找哪里的?
Where to?



雨林区 藤蔓路和图洪加路交叉口
Uh, Rainforest District, Vine and Tujunga.



找到了! 全城的道路监控都在了
There! Traffic cams for the whole city.



说实话 这太激动了!
Oh, this is so exciting, actually!



我从来没机会做这么重要的事
I never get to do anything this important.



可你是动物城的副市长啊
But you're the Assistant Mayor of Zootopia.



说难听点 我不过就是个秘书罢了
Oh, I'm more of a glorified secretary.



我觉得狮市长只是想要绵羊的选票才给我职位
I think Mayor Lionheart just wanted the sheep vote.



但他倒是给了我这漂亮的马克杯
But he did give me that nice mug.



{\an8}世上最好的副市长(爸爸)



我很高兴能受到认可
Feels good to be appreciated.



小臭羊!
Smellwether!



他给我起了这么个有趣的外号
Ugh. That's a fun little name he likes to use.



我叫过他一次屎市长
I called him Lion-fart once.



他很不喜欢那样 告诉你们吧...
He did not care for that. Let me tell you...



那一天我过得挺不顺的
it was not a good day for me.



怎么了 先生?
Yes, sir?



我不是叫你把下午的事都取消了吗!
I thought you were going to cancel my afternoon!



天啊 我得走了
Oh, dear. I better go.



有结果了请告诉我
Let me know what you find.



我很乐意能为你们...
It was really nice for me to be...



时间不等人啊...
While we're young...



小臭羊!

What is it with wolves and the howling? It's like...



嚎叫 午夜嚎叫
Howlers. Night Howlers.



曼查斯害怕的就是这个! 狼!
That's what Manchas was afraid of! Wolves!



那些狼就是午夜嚎叫
The wolves are the Night Howlers.



如果他们带走了曼查斯...
If they took Manchas...



奥獭顿一定也在他们手上
I'll bet they took Otterton, too.



咱们得找出他们去了什么地方
All we gotta do is find out where they went.



等等 他们去哪了?
Wait, where did they go?



要是我想躲开监控...
You know, if I wanted to avoid surveillance...



以便做点违法的事...
because I was doing something illegal...



当然我没做过...
which I never have...



我就会走6B号维修通道
I would use the maintenance tunnel 6B.



这样他们就会从...
Which would put them out...



那里出来
right there.



瞧你的 少年侦探
Well, look at you, Junior Detective.



说起来 我还真觉得你能...
You know, I think you'd actually...

他们要出城
They're heading out of town.



那条路通往哪里?
Where does that road go?



{\an8}悬崖病院



盖瑞 闭嘴!

你会引发群嚎的
You're gonna start a howl.



不是我先叫的
I didn't start it!

我们正竭尽所能进行研究
We're doing everything we can.



是吗?
Really?



我这里可是有一打半的动物...
Because I got a dozen and a half animals here...



全都已经发疯了...
who have gone off-the-rails crazy...



而你却答不上来原因
and you can't tell me why.



这可远远称不上是 "竭尽所能"
Now, I'd call that awfully far from "doing everything."



先生...
Sir...



也许我们应该从生理角度去看待它了
it may be time to consider their biology.



什么? 什么叫 "生理角度"?
What? What do you mean "biology?"



只有肉食动物才会野蛮化
The only animals going savage are predators.



这事不能秘而不宣 我们需要告诉民众
We cannot keep it a secret. We need to come forward.



好主意 告诉民众
Hmm. Great idea. Tell the public.

你只想保住自己的官位罢了
You were just trying to protect your job.



不 听着 我们还没弄清楚事发原因
No. Listen, we still don't know why this is happening.



这事会毁了动物城的
It could destroy Zootopia.



你有权保持沉默
You have the right to remain silent.



你所说的任何话都会...
Anything you say can and will...



作为呈堂证供
be used against you in a court of law.



你有权...
You have the right...



女士先生动物们
Ladies and gentlemammals.



14位失踪的哺乳动物...
14 mammals went missing...



现已被我局的新任警官全部找回
and all 14 have been found by our newest recruit..



接下来将由她为大家讲话
who will speak to you in a moment.



但是 首先我要提醒你们...
But first, let me remind you...



我好紧张
Ugh. I'm so nervous.



好了 新闻发布会基本知识
Okay. Press Conference 101.



想显得聪明吗?
You wanna look smart?



用自己的问题回答他们的问题...
Answer their question with your own question...



然后再自问自答 像这样
and then answer that question. Like this.



请问霍普斯警官...
Excuse me. Officer Hopps...



关于这个案子你有什么可以透露的吗?
Uh what can you tell us about the case?



这是个困难的案子吗?
Well was this a tough case?



是的 案子很困难 懂了吗?
Yes yes, it was. You see?



你应该和我一起上台
You should be there with me.



案子是我们一起破的
We did this together.



是吗 我是警察吗? 不 我不是
Well, am I a cop? No. No, I am not.



这话说得正是时候...
Hmm. Funny you should say that...



因为我在考虑...
because I've been thinking...



如果有个搭档就好了
It would be nice to have a partner.



给你 万一你想写些什么 用这个
Here. In case you need something to write with.



在晚间22:00时
At twenty two hundred hours... 



我们找到了所有的失踪动物
we found all these missing animals... 



霍普斯警官 该你上台了
Officer Hopps, it's time. 



从外表看来他们都十分健康 
They appear to be in good health, physically... 



但心理上远非如此
if not emotionally. 



接下来 有请...
So now, I'll turn things over... 



成功破案的警官
to the officer who cracked the case. 



朱迪·霍普斯警官
Officer Judy Hopps. 



- 霍普斯警官 请看这里!  - 霍普斯警官! 
- Officer Hopps!  - Officer Hopps! 



请看这边! 
Over here! 



请讲
Yes? 



您对这些野蛮化的动物作何评价? 
What can you tell us about the animals that went savage? 



大家十分关心的动物们... 
Well, the animals in question, um... 



他们都是不同物种吗? 
Are they all different species?  



是的 没错
Yes. Yes, they are. 



那么这之间有何联系呢? 
Okay, so what is the connection? 



我们只知道...
Oh, all we know is that they... 



他们都是食肉动物
are all members of the predator family. 



所以 只有食肉动物会野蛮化吗? 
So, predators are the only ones going savage? 



没错 的确如此 没错
That is ac... Yes, that is accurate. Yes. 



为什么呢? 为何会发生这种情况? 
Why? Why is this happening? 



原因我们尚不清楚
We still don't know. 



但是 或许这与生物机理有关
But,emm... It may have something to do with biology. 



这是什么意思? 
What do you mean by that? 



就是说一种生物构成
A biological component. 



在他们的DNA里
You know, something in their DNA. 



在他们的DNA里? 您能说得再详细些吗? 
In their DNA? Can you elaborate on that, please? 



可以 我是说千年前
Yes, what I mean is, thousands of years ago... 



食肉动物凭其残忍的狩猎本能
uh, predators survived through their aggressive... 



得以繁衍生息
hunting instincts.



不知为何
For whatever reason,  



如今他们似乎...
they seem to be reverting back... 



回归了本性 野蛮的本性
to their primitive, savage ways. 



显然是这样
Of course they did. 



哎呦 他要哭了吗? 
Aw, is he gonna cry? 



霍普斯警官 这种情况会再次发生吗? 
Officer Hopps, could it happen again? 



很有可能 所以我们必须警惕
It is possible. So we must be vigilant. 



警局也已经准备好保护所有居民
And we at the ZPD are prepared and are here to protect you. 



会有更多动物野蛮化吗? 
Will more mammals go savage?



有什么保护居民的措施? 
What is being done to protect us? 



有考虑过
Have you considered



强制隔离食肉动物吗? 
a mandatory quarantine on predators? 



感谢霍普斯警官
Okay, thank you, Officer Hopps. 



提问时间结束
Uh, that's all the time that we have. No more questions. 



我表现如何? 
Was I okay? 



很不错
Oh, you did fine. 



时间太少了
Oh, that went so fast. 



我还没来得及介绍你
I didn't get a chance to mention you... 



还有我们是怎么... 
or say anything about how we...



我觉得你讲得很全面了
Oh, I think you said plenty. 



什么意思? 
What do you mean? 



"很明显 这与生物构成有关? "
"Clearly there's a biological component? "



"他们似乎回归了...
"These predators may be reverting back...



野蛮的本性? "
to their primitive, savage ways?"



你是认真的吗? 
Are you serious? 



我只是陈述案件事实
I just stated the facts of the case. 



譬如兔子就不可能变得野蛮
I mean, it's not like a bunny could go savage. 



是啊 但是狐狸会 对吧?
Right. But a fox could, huh? 



尼克 别这样 你和他们不一样
Nick, stop it. You're not like them. 



"他们"是谁呢? 
Oh, there's a "them" now? 



你懂我的意思
Ugh. You know what I mean. 



你不是那种肉食动物
You're not that kind of predator. 



要戴上口套的那种吗? 
The kind that needs to be muzzled? 



要你用防狐喷雾
The kind that makes you think... 



对付的那种吗? 
you need to carry around fox repellent? 



第一次见面...
Yeah, don't think I didn't... 



我就发现你带着那瓶小东西
notice that little item the first time we met.



我问你 你怕我吗? 
So let me ask you a question. Are you afraid of me? 



你觉得我会发疯吗? 
Do you think l might go nuts? 



你觉得我会野蛮化吗? 
Do you think I might go savage? 



我会不会想要... 
Do you think I might try to...



吃了你? 
eat you?



早就知道了
I knew it.



还以为真有人会相信我呢
Just when I thought somebody actually believed in me, huh.



你最好还是别找食肉动物做搭档了
Probably best if you don't have a predator as a partner. 



不 尼克 尼克! 
No. Nick. Nick!



霍普斯警官! 你是被那只食肉动物威胁了吗? 
Officer Hopps! Were you just threatened by that predator?



不 他是我的朋友
No, he's my friend.



我们甚至连朋友都无法相信了吗? 
We can't even trust our own friends?



我不是那个意思! 请让让! 
That is not what I said! Please! 



我们安全吗? 
Are we safe? 



有没有狐狸野蛮化了? 
Have any of our foxes gone savage? 



更多坏消息让城市被恐惧笼罩

希望你能来做警局的形象代言人
want you to be the public face of the ZPD.



我... 我不是...

我不是什么英雄

因为你勇于尝试
Because you're a trier, that's why.

在这里向你道歉
for the way I behaved in my youth. 



我很缺乏自信 为证明自己强大
I had a lot of self- doubt, and it manifested itself... 



才不断地欺负他人和惹是生非
in the form of unchecked rage and aggression. 



我真是个混蛋
I was a major jerk. 



其实我有时候也挺混蛋的
Oh, I know a thing or two about being a jerk.

你手臂上还有个大坑呢
There's a sizable divot in your arm. 



要我说那就是野蛮
I'd call that savage. 



午夜嚎叫指的不是狼 而是花! 
Night Howlers aren't wolves, they're flowers! 



是这些花让食肉动物发狂的! 
The flowers are making the predators go savage! 



原来如此! 
That's it!

我得弥补这一切

你怎么恨我
you can hate me.

市场上所有的午夜嚎叫

撒哈拉广场上的猎豹 明白了

Listen, I hit a tiny little otter...



射中一只小个子水獭

to do a little victory toot-toot?



好吧 就拉一下好了
All right. One toot-toot.



能把这个从愿望清单上划掉了
Well, I can cross that off the bucket list.



现在就庆祝胜利看起来太早了
I may have to rescind that victory toot- toot.

Judy!



羊市长!
Mayor Bellwether!



我们查明了整件事
We found out what's happening.



有人用血清狙击食肉动物

这是他们野蛮化的原因
That's what's making them go savage.



我为你骄傲 朱迪 你干得太棒了!
I'm so proud of you, Judy. You did just a super job!



谢谢你 女士
Thank you, ma'am.

我走不动了
I can't walk.



我们会想到办法的
Just... We'll think of something.



我们是一条船上的 朱迪
We're on the same team, Judy.



没人肯定 没人赞赏
Underestimated, underappreciated.



你还没受够吗?
Aren't you sick of it?



食肉动物可能又强壮又嚣张...
Predators. They may be strong and loud...



可是食草动物的数量是他们的十倍
but prey outnumber predators 10 to 1.



想想吧
Think of it.



90%的人...
90% of the population...



团结起来对付共同的敌人
united against a common enemy.



我们将势不可挡
We'll be unstoppable.



哈?
Huh?



那边!
Over there!



救命!
Help!



哈 你本该留在...
Well, you should have just stayed...



胡萝卜农场里的 对吧?
on the carrot farm, huh?

He is.



不! 噢 尼克!
No! Oh, Nick!



警察! 自然历史博物馆里...
Yes, police! There's a savage fox...



有一只野蛮化的狐狸
in the Natural History Museum.



霍普斯警官受伤了! 赶紧 快来
Officer Hopps is down! Please, hurry.



不要 尼克 别这么干 坚持住
No. Nick, don't do this. Fight it.



可他忍不住的 不是吗?
Oh, but he can't help it, can he?



因为食肉动物生理上...
Since preds are just biologically...



就是容易变得野蛮
predisposed to be savages.



天啊 想象一下新闻头条!
Gosh. Think of the headline!



英雄警察死于野蛮化的狐狸之手!
Hero cop killed by savage fox!



这就是你的计划? 让食草动物害怕食肉动物...
So that's it? Prey fears predator...



而你继续当权?
and you stay in power?



是的 就是如此
Yeah, pretty much.



你的计划行不通的!
It won't work!



恐惧总能行得通
Fear always works.



为此 我情愿朝城里的每一个食肉动物...
And I'll dart every predator...



都来上一发
in Zootopia to keep it that way.



噢 尼克
Oh, Nick.



不要
No.



再见啦 小兔子
Bye-bye, bunny.



呃...
Bleh...



血! 血! 血! 然后死亡
Blood! Blood! Blood and death.



好了 你演的太过了
All right, you know, you're milking it.



而且 我想我们已经得手了
Besides, I think we got it.



我们已经得手了 谢谢 羊烦烦!
We got it up there, thank you, Yakety-yak!



你把整件事说得一清二楚
You laid it all out beautifully.



什么?
What?



噢 你在找血清吗?
Yeah... Oh, are you looking for the serum?



在这呢
Well, it's right here.



你枪里装的是什么呢?
What you've got in the weapon there?



那是蓝莓 来自我家的农场
Those are blueberries. From my family's farm.



非常好吃 你该尝尝
They are delicious. You should try some.



我陷害了狮市长 我也能陷害你们
I framed Lionheart. I can frame you, too.



你们不过是空口说白话
It's my word against yours.



事实上...
Oh, actually...



我情愿朝城里的每一个食肉动物...
And I'll dart every predator...



都来上一发
in Zootopia to keep it that way.



是你空口说白话
It's your word against yours.



这叫做智取 亲爱的 嘣
It's called a hustle, sweetheart. Boom.



前任羊市长今日入狱...
Former mayor Dawn Bellwether is behind bars today...



她是近期动物城内...
guilty of masterminding the savage attacks...



食肉动物野蛮化事件的主谋
that have plagued Zootopia of late.



她的前任 狮市长
Her predecessor, Leodore Lionheart.



否认了解她的任何阴谋...
denies any knowledge of her plot...



宣称他只是在保护城市
claiming he was just trying to protect the city.



监禁那些动物是错误的行为吗?
Did I falsely imprison those animals?



是的 的确如此
Well, yes. Yes, I did.



可这是典型的...
It was a classic "doing the wrong thing...



"为了正确的目的 采取错误的行动"
"for the right reason" kind of a deal.



在相关新闻中 医生声明...
In related news, doctors say..



午夜嚎叫的解药...
the Night Howler antidote is proving effective...



在帮助受害者恢复方面效果显著
in rehabilitating the afflicted predators.



埃米特
Emmitt.



噢 埃米特
Oh, Emmitt.



谢谢
Thank you.



当我还是个孩子时...
When I was a kid...



我认为动物城是一个完美的地方
I thought Zootopia was this perfect place.



在那里人人和谐相处 一切皆有可能
Where everyone got along and anyone could be anything.



可事实是...
Turns out...



现实生活比贴纸上的口号
real life's a little bit more complicated.



要复杂一点
than a slogan on a bumper sticker.



现实生活纷繁复杂
Real life is messy.



我们都有局限 都会犯错误
We all have limitations. We all make mistakes.



但乐观点看 大家都彼此彼此嘛...
Which means, hey, glass half-full...



我们都有共同点
we all have a lot in common.



越是尝试互相理解...
And the more we try to understand one another...



我们就越出色
the more exceptional each of us will be.



但我们必须去尝试
But we have to try.



因此 无论你是哪类动物...
So, no matter what type of animal you are...



从最大的大象...
from the biggest elephant...



到我们之中的第一位狐狸警官...
to our first fox..



请你... 努力尝试
I implore you... try.



尝试让这个世界变得更美好
Try to make the world a better place.

and recognize that change...

starts with you.



从我开始
It starts with me.



从我们每个人开始
It starts with all of us.

All right. All right, enough! Shut it!

We have some new recruits with us this morning...



包括我们的第一位狐狸警官
including our first fox.
