我们看戏  看厌了虚伪的表情
We've become bored With watching actors give us phony emotions.



看厌了花巧的特技
We're tired Of pyrotechnics and special effects.



楚门的世界…

楚门本人却半点不假
There's nothing fake About truman himself--



这节目没有剧本  没有提场
No scripts No cue cards.



未必是杰作  但如假包换
It isn't always shakespeare, But it's genuine.

是…
It's a noble life.



美满的生活
It is...a truly blessed life.



我还有什么不知道  你说吧
Yeah, tell me something I  don't   know.



好  你要答应我一件事
All right. Promise me One thing, though.



未到达山顶  而我死去…
If i die before i reach The summit,



你要把我当作粮食
You'll use me as An alternative source of food.



好恶心
Ew. Gross.



(高路易饰演马龙)



内容真真实实  原原本本
It's all true. It's all real.



各位所见的  绝无虚假
Nothing here is fake.Nothing you see On this show is fake.



有的只是调控
It's merely controlled.



楚门的世界



吃掉我  我命令你
Eat me, damn it.That's an order.

桃源岛是一个 规模空前庞大的片场
Coming to you now From seahaven island, Enclosed in the largest Studio ever constructed



从太空俯瞰地球可以看到的
And along with The great wall of china,



唯有桃源岛和万里长城
One of only 2 manmade structures Visible from space,



"真人表演"已经踏入



光辉的第三十年
Now in its 30th great year, It's...



过去一个星期
What a week it's been.



高潮迭起  好戏连场
I don't know about you--I was on pins and needles The entire time.



各位观众好  我是米高
Hello and good evening. I'm your host mike michaelson,



欢迎收看"真人表演"的 清谈节目"真话"
And welcome to  tru-talk, Our forum for issues Growing out of the show.



今晚千载难逢
But tonight, Something very special indeed,



会独家专访 "真人表演"的创作人
A rare and Exclusive interview With the show's Conceiver and creator.



我们上去天网摄制 221楼的太阴室
So, come with us now as we Go live to the lunar room On the 221st floor Of the omni cam echosphere



采访超级电视摄制的先驱
Where we'll find the world's Greatest tele-visionary--



桃源岛的设计者和总监
The designer and architect Of the world within a world



基斯督
That is seahaven island-- Christof.



我先代表观众多谢你接受专访
Before we begin, I'd like to thank you On behalf of our audience For granting this interview.



我们知道你工作繁忙 一向作风都是尽量低调
We know how demanding Your schedule is And we all know how jealously You guard your privacy.



能够采访你  我深感荣幸
This, sir, Is indeed an honor.



不要客气
Don't mention it.



"真人表演"最近的一波三折
Well, the catalyst for The recent dramatic events



起因是楚门的父亲偷偷回去
On the show has been Truman's father, kirk



外面的人擅闯桃源要接触楚门
And his attempts To infiltrate the show.



But before we get into that, I think it's worth noting



这并不是首次  对不对?
That this is not the first time Someone from the outside



但都是有惊无险
Has attempted To reach truman, is it? Christof: we have had Close calls in the past.



楚门  上电视了
Man: truman! It's television!



我终于上了"真人表演"
Yes! Yes! I did it! I'm on  the truman show!



但历来的擅闯事件中
Mike: but there's never Been anything to compare



最近这次最严重
With this most recent Breach in security--



因为擅闯的人是前任演员
The first intruder to be A former cast member.



而且本来已经死了
A dead one at that.



你让却克复出  是神来之笔
Gotta say, writing kirk Back in--masterstroke.



既然这场风波由却克引起
Since kirk started this Crisis in truman's life,



我认为解铃还须系铃人
I came to the conclusion That only he could end it.



阿仁…
Truman! Truman!



-不准过去 -那里有什么?
No! That's off limits! Why? What's Over there?



[construction noises]



没什么  只是危险
Nothing. It's dangerous. That's all.



你要记着  有些地方不可以去
You've got to know Your limitations, truman.



当年为什么删除却克这角色?
Mike: but let's remind Viewers exactly why Dad was written out In the first place.



楚门长大 我们设法把他留在桃源岛
Christof: as truman grew up, We were forced To manufacture ways To keep him on the island.

于是  我安排却克浸死
Christof: finally, i came up With kirk's drowning.



那办法很有效  楚门从此怕水
Mike: most effective. Truman's been terrified Of the water ever since.



却克被迫浸死  退出节目

不消说  失望得很

Was the very reason He was the one selected.



我们从六个待领养胎儿中
In competition with 5 other Unwanted pregnancies,



选出楚门  因为楚门…

在现场直播中  准时出世
Truman was the one Who arrived on cue.



楚门似乎是首名被机构
Mike: incidentally, i believe Truman is the first child



合法领养的孩子
To have been legally adopted By a corporation.



对
That's correct.



节目带来庞大的收益
The show has generated Enormous revenues now,



相当于一个小国的年产总值

我们都认得这把声音 怎能忘记?

你以为自己曾向楚门抛眉弄眼
You think because you batted Your eyes at truman once...



打情骂俏 曾和他一起出镜几分钟

就以为了解他?

有资格去评论他?

你有什么权…

他随时可以走

假如他稍有野心
If his was more Than just a vague ambition,



假如他下定决心要查出真相
If he was absolutely determined To discover the truth,



我们无法阻止他
There's no way We could prevent him.



你不安  其实另有原因
I think what distresses You really, caller,



就是楚门甘愿坐你所谓的监狱
Is that ultimately...Truman prefers his cell, As you call it.



你错了
That's where You're wrong.



大错特错  他会证明你是错的
