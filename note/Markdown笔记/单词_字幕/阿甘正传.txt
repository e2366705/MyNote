你好
Hello.



我叫弗里斯特  弗里斯特·甘
My name's Forrest. Forrest Gump.



你想吃一块巧克力吗
Do you want a chocolate?



我可以吃下150万块这东西
I could eat about a million and a half of these.



我妈妈总是说
My mama always said



生活就像一盒巧克力
life was like a box of chocolates.



你永远不知道你将得到什么
You never know what you're gonna get.



你这双鞋一定很舒服
Those must be comfortable shoes.



我猜穿着这种鞋
I'll bet you could walk all day



走一整天都不会累
in shoes like that and not feel a thing.



我也想要那样的鞋
I wish I had shoes like that.



我的脚很疼
My feet hurt.



妈妈总是说
Mama always said



你可以通过鞋来了解一个人的很多方面
there's an awful lot you could tell about a person by their shoes:



他们要去哪儿  他们去过哪儿
where they're going, where they've been.



我穿坏过很多双鞋
I've worn lots of shoes.



我猜如果我仔细想想
I bet if I think about it real hard,



就能想起我的第一双鞋
I could remember my first pair of shoes.



妈妈说它们能带我去任何地方
Mama said they'd take me anywhere.



她说它们是我的魔法鞋子
She said they was my magic shoes.



好了  弗里斯特  你可以睁开眼睛了
All right, Forrest, you can open your eyes now.



走一走试试看
Let's take a little walk around.



感觉怎么样
How do those feel?



他的腿很强壮  甘夫人
His legs are strong, Mrs. Gump,



是我见过最强壮的
as strong as I've ever seen,



但是他的脊背像政客一样扭曲
but his back is as crooked as a politician.



不过我们会把他扳直的  对吧  弗里斯特
But we're gonna straighten him right up, now, aren't we, Forrest?



弗里斯特
Forrest!



我还是婴儿的时候
Now, when I was a baby,



妈妈用南北战争时期伟大的英雄
Mama named me after the great Civil War hero,



内森·弗里斯特将军的名字给我取了名
General Nathan Bedford Forrest.



她说我们和他有什么亲缘关系
She said we was related to him in some way.



他做过的事情是
And what he did was,



他创建了一个叫三K党的俱乐部
he started up this club called the Ku Klux Klan.



他们都披着长袍和床单
They'd all dress up in their robes and their bed sheets



表现得像鬼魂或幽灵之类的
and act like a bunch of ghosts or spooks or something.



他们甚至给马披上床单  骑着到处跑
They'd even put bed sheets on their horses and ride around.



不管怎样  我的名字就是这么来的
And anyway, that's how I got my name,



弗里斯特·甘
Forrest Gump.



妈妈说"弗里斯特"这个名字
Mama said that the "Forrest" part



是用来提醒我  有时候我们都会做
was to remind me that sometimes we all do things that,



没有道理的事
well, just don't make no sense.



好了  出来  出来
Okay... Get it, get it...



等等  是这边吗  等一下
Wait, is it this way? Hold on.



好了
All right...



你们看什么看
What are you all staring at?



你们没见过腿上
Haven't you ever seen a little boy



装着支架的小男孩吗
with braces on his legs before?



别让任何人告诉你他们高你一等  弗里斯特
Don't ever let anybody tell you they're better than you, Forrest.



如果上帝希望每个人都是一样的
If God intended everybody to be the same,



他就会让我们的腿上都装着支架
he'd have given us all braces on our legs.



妈妈总是有办法把事情解释得
Mama always had a way of explaining things



让我也能听懂
so I could understand them.



我们住在离17号公路四百米远的地方
We lived about a quarter mile off Route 17,



离阿拉巴马州绿弓镇大约八百米
about a half mile from the town of Greenbow, Alabama.



那地方隶属绿弓县
That's in the county of Greenbow.



自从大约一千年前我妈妈的
Our house had been in Mama's family



爷爷的爷爷的爷爷漂洋过海来到这里
since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa



这栋房子就一直是我妈妈家的
had come across the ocean about 1,000 years ago,



差不多是这样
something like that.



由于家里只有我和妈妈 
Since it was just me and Mama



而我们又有那么多空房间
and we had all these empty rooms,



妈妈决定把那些房间租出去
Mama decided to let those rooms out,



主要是租给过路人
mostly to people passing through,



他们来自莫比尔  蒙哥马利之类的地方
like from, oh, Mobile, Montgomery, places like that.



我和妈妈的钱就是这么来的
That's how me and Mama got money.



妈妈是个很聪明的女人
Mama was a real smart lady.



记住我跟你说的话  弗里斯特
Remember what I told you, Forrest.



你和其他人没什么不同
You're no different than anybody else is.



{\an8}{\pos(331.18,108.356)}甘氏大宅
房间出租



你听见我说的话了吗  弗里斯特
Did you hear what I said, Forrest?



你和其他人一样  没什么不同
You're the same as everybody else. You are no different.



你儿子和其他人不同  甘夫人  
Your boy's different, Mrs. Gump.



他的智商只有75
Now, his IQ is 75.



我们每个人都与众不同  汉考克先生
Well, we're all different, Mr. Hancock.



她想让我接受最好的教育
She wanted me to have the finest education,



所以她带我去了绿弓县中心学校
so she took me to the Greenbow County Central School.



我见了校长
I met the principal and all.



我给你看样东西  甘夫人
I want to show you something, Mrs. Gump.



这是正常范围
Now, this is normal.



{\an8}{\pos(169.2,85.333)}智商分数  全国平均水平



{\an8}{\pos(167.2,107.733)}高于



{\an8}{\pos(167.2,144.533)}正常
国家要求

弗里斯特在这里
Forrest is right here.



国家要求智商至少达到80
The state requires a minimum IQ of 80



才能上公立学校  甘夫人
to attend public school, Mrs. Gump.



他得去特殊学校
He's gonna have to go to a special school.



他会没事的
Now, he'll be just fine.



"正常"到底是什么意思呢
What does "normal" mean, anyway?



他也许稍微有点迟钝
He might be a bit on the slow side,



但我儿子弗里斯特
but my boy Forrest



要得到和其他人一样的机会
is gonna get the same opportunities as everyone else.



他才不要去什么特殊学校
He's not going to some special school



学习如何更换轮胎
to learn how to re-tread tires.



只有区区5分的差距而已
We're talking about five little points here.



一定有解决办法的
There must be something can be done.



我们是先进教学体系的学校
We're a progressive school system.



我们不想看到任何人落后
We don't want to see anybody left behind.



你有丈夫吗  甘夫人
Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?



他在外度假
He's on vacation.



你妈妈确实很关心你的学业  孩子 
Well, your mama sure does care about your schooling, son.



你的话不多  是吗
You don't say much, do you?



最后  他不得不试一试
"Finally, he had to try.



看起来简单  但是
"It looked easy, but,



天呐  发生了什么
"Oh, what happened.



-首先...  -妈  度假是什么意思
- "First, there..." - Mama, what's "vacation" mean?



-度假  -爸爸去的地方
- Vacation? - Where Daddy went.



度假就是你去一个地方
Vacation's when you go somewhere



然后再也不回来
and you don't ever come back.



总之  我想你可以说  我和妈妈只能靠自己
Anyway, I guess you could say me and Mama was on our own.



不过我们不介意  我们的房子总是住满了人
But we didn't mind. Our house was never empty.



总是有人来来去去
There was always folks coming and going.



吃晚饭了
Supper.



-吃晚饭了  各位  -天呐
- It's supper, everyone. - My, my.



-弗里斯特  -看起来真特别
- Forrest... - That sure looks special.



有时候住在我们家的人太多了
Sometimes we had so many people staying with us



每个房间都挤满了旅行者
that every room was filled with travelers.



就是那些  靠行李箱和帽箱
You know, folks living out of their suitcases



和样品箱生活的人
and hat cases and sample cases.



弗里斯特·甘  吃晚饭了  弗里斯特
Forrest Gump, it's suppertime! Forrest...



有一次  一个年轻人住在我们家
One time, a young man was staying with us,



他带着一个吉他箱
and he had him a guitar case.



弗里斯特  我跟你说了别打扰这个好心的年轻人
Forrest! I told you not to bother this nice young man.



没事的  夫人
Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am.



我只是给他展示一下吉他
I was just showing him a thing or two on the guitar here.



好吧  如果你们想吃晚饭的话  已经准备好了
All right, but your supper's ready if y'all want to eat.



好  听起来不错  谢谢  夫人
Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you, ma'am.



小家伙  再给我看看你刚刚那个疯狂的步伐
Say, man, show me that crazy little walk you just did there.



稍微慢一点
Slow it down some.



我喜欢那把吉他
I liked that guitar.



很好听
It sounded good.



我开始随着音乐移动
I started moving around to the music,



摆动我的臀部
swinging my hips.



有一天晚上  我和妈妈出去买东西
This one night, me and Mama was out shopping,



我们路过本森家居用品店
and we walked right by Benson's furniture and appliance store,



你猜怎么着
and guess what?



这不是给孩子看的
This is not for children's eyes.



几年后  那个英俊的年轻人
Some years later, that handsome young man



也就是被称为"猫王"的那个传奇
who they called "The King,"



他唱了太多的歌
well, he'd sung too many songs,



心脏病发作了
had himself a heart attack, or something.



当王一定很辛苦吧
Must be hard being a king.



有趣的是你记得一些事情
You know, it's funny how you remember some things,



但是有些事情却记不起来
but some things you can't.



你要全力以赴  弗里斯特
You do your very best now, Forrest.



我会的  妈妈
I sure will, Mama.



我清楚地记得开学第一天乘校车的情景
I remember the bus ride on the first day of school very well.



你到底要不要上车
Are you coming along?



妈妈说不要搭陌生人的车
Mama said not to be taking rides from strangers.



这是去学校的校车
This is the bus to school.



我叫弗里斯特  弗里斯特·甘
I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.



我叫多洛希·哈里斯  
I'm Dorothy Harris.



现在我们不是陌生人了
Well, now we ain't strangers anymore.



这个座位有人了
This seat's taken.



有人了
It's taken!



你不能坐在这里
You can't sit here.



小孩子的记忆很有趣
You know, it's funny what a young man recollects,



因为我不记得我是怎么出生的
'cause I don't remember being born.



我不记得我在第一个圣诞节收到了什么礼物
I don't recall what I got for my first Christmas,



我也不记得我第一次去野餐是什么时候
and I don't know when I went on my first outdoor picnic.



但是我清楚地记得第一次听到
But I do remember the first time I heard



那个世界上最甜美的声音
the sweetest voice in the wide world.



如果你愿意  可以坐在这里
You can sit here if you want.



我一生中从未见过如此美丽的存在
I had never seen anything so beautiful in my life.



她就像一个天使

你到底坐不坐
Well, are you gonna sit down, or aren't you?



你的腿怎么了
What's wrong with your legs?



没什么  谢谢关心  我的腿好得很
Nothing at all, thank you. My legs are just fine and dandy.



在校车上  我坐在她身旁
I just sat next to her on that bus



和她一路聊到学校
and had a conversation all the way to school.



我的脊背像问号一样弯曲
...my back's crooked like a question mark.



这些支架会让我...
These are going to make me...



除了我妈  
And next to Mama,



从来没有人和我说过话或者问我问题
no one ever talked to me or asked me questions.



你是不是傻
Are you stupid or something?



妈妈说  "只有做傻事的才是傻子"

-我叫珍妮  -我叫弗里斯特  弗里斯特·甘

她教我怎么爬树

I showed her how to dangle.



一直乖巧的小猴子和...
"A good little monkey and..."



她帮助我识字
She helped me learn how to read,



我教她怎么倒挂金钩
and I showed her how to swing.



有时候我们只是坐在外面  等着看星星
Sometimes we'd just sit out and wait for the stars.



妈妈会担心我的 
Mama's gonna worry about me.



留下再多待一会儿吧
Just stay a little longer.



不知为什么  珍妮从来不想回家
For some reason, Jenny didn't never want to go home.



好的  珍妮  我留下陪你
Okay, Jenny, I'll stay.



她是我最特别的朋友
She was my most special friend.



我唯一的朋友

妈妈总是跟我说  奇迹每天都会发生

有些人不这么认为  但是确实如此
Some people don't think so, but they do.



嘿  笨蛋
Hey, dummy!



你是弱智  还是傻子
Are you retarded, or just plain stupid?



"看啊  我是弗里斯特·瘸子" 
"Look, I'm Forrest Gimp."

就算我告诉你  你也不会相信
Now, you wouldn't believe it if I told you,



但是我可以跑得像风一样快
but I can run like the wind blows.



从那天起  如果我要去什么地方
From that day on, if I was going somewhere,



我就跑着去
I was running!



他要跑了  拦住他
He's getting away! Stop him!



那孩子真是个跑得快的傻子
That boy sure is a running fool.



还记得我跟你说过
Now, remember how I told you that



珍妮似乎从来不想回家吗
Jenny never seemed to want to go home?



她住的房子有阿拉巴马州那么古老
Well, she lived in a house that was as old as Alabama.

亲爱的上帝  把我变成一只鸟
Dear God, make me a bird



这样我就能逃离这里  远走高飞
so I can fly far, far, far away from here.



亲爱的上帝  把我变成一只鸟
Dear God, make me a bird



这样我就能逃离这里  远走高飞
so I can fly far, far, far away from here.



妈妈总说上帝是神秘的
Mama always said that God is mysterious.



珍妮
Jenny!



那天祂没有把珍妮变成一只鸟
He didn't turn Jenny into a bird that day.



你最好给我赶快回来
You'd better get back here!



但是
Instead,



祂叫来了警察
he had the police say



说珍妮再也不用住在那个房子里了
Jenny didn't have to stay in that house no more.



她搬去和她外婆住了  就住在克里克莫尔大道
She went to live with her grandma just over on Creekmore Avenue,



我很开心  因为这样她就离我家很近了
which made me happy, 'cause she was so close.



珍妮有时晚上会偷偷溜到我家来玩
Some nights, Jenny would sneak out and come on over to my house,



只是因为她说自己害怕
just 'cause she said she was scared.



我不知道她害怕什么
Scared of what, I don't know,

Just a local idiot.



你敢信吗  我也能去上大学了

厄尔

- Coons are trying to get into school. - Coons?



如果浣熊想进我家后院
When raccoons try to get on our back porch,



我妈就会用扫帚赶走它们
Mama just chase them off with a broom.

Not raccoons, you idiot, niggers,



他们想和我们一起上学
and they want to go to school with us.



和我们同校  当真吗
With us? They do?



华莱士州长履行承诺
Shortly after Governor Wallace had carried out his promise



封锁大门后不久
to block the doorway,



肯尼迪总统就命令国防部长
President Kennedy ordered the Secretary of Defense



使用武力干预
then to use military force.



本台播放的录像记录了当时国民警卫队指挥官

commander of the National Guard, and Governor Wallace.



因为今日在此的国民警卫队
...because these National Guardsmen are here today



身份是阿拉巴马州的联邦士兵
as federal soldiers for Alabamans.



他们住在本州境内  他们都是我们的兄弟
They live within our borders, they are all our brothers.



我们取得了这场战争的胜利
We are winning in this fight,



因为我们正在唤醒美国人民
because we are awakening the American people



看清我们此前多次强调的危机
to the dangers that we have spoken about so many times,



今日之事再次证明
just so evident today,



本国正在走向军事独裁

我还在上大学
I was in college.



你上的是女校
Did you go to a girls' college,



还是男女混校
or to a girls-and-boys-together college?



男女混校
It was co-ed.



珍妮上的大学我就不能去上
'Cause Jenny went to a college I couldn't go to.



那个大学只收女生
It was a college just for girls.



但我一有机会就会去看她
But I'd go and visit her every chance I got.



好疼
That hurts.

- Don't go! Billy, wait a second! - Get away from me.



他完全不懂事的
He doesn't know any better!



弗里斯特  你为什么要那样做
Forrest, why did you do that?



我给你带了点巧克力来
I brought you some chocolate.



对不起
I'm sorry.

你永远都会是你  只是你还有其他可能
Well, you'll always be you, just another kind of you.



明白吗 
You know?



我想出名
I want to be famous.



我想成为像琼·贝兹一样的歌手
I want to be a singer like Joan Baez.



我只想站在空旷的舞台上

不久后  莫名其妙地

一开始  我觉得自己做了个错误的决定
At first, it seemed like I made a mistake,



因为入伍的第一天
seeing how it was only my induction day

and I was already getting yelled at.



如果你愿意  可以坐在这里

我不知道自己会遇到什么人  或者被问什么问题
I didn't know who I might meet, or what they might ask.

我一开始是在我舅舅的船上  就是我妈妈的弟弟

阿甘  你是为了什么来参军的
Gump! What's your sole purpose in this Army?



为了完成你下达的任何指令  德尔中士
To do whatever you tell me, Drill Sergeant!



该死的  阿甘  你真他妈是个天才
God damn it, Gump! You're a goddamn genius!



这是我听过的最优秀的答案

你的智商一定有他们的160分

你真他妈有天赋  二等兵甘
You are goddamn gifted, Private Gump!



全体都听好了
Listen up, people!



不知为何
Now, for some reason,



我在军队里混得如鱼得水
I fit in the Army like one of them round pegs.



这真的并不难
It's not really hard.



你只需把床铺得很整齐
You just make your bed real neat



记得站直
and remember to stand up straight,



并且总是用"是  德尔中士"来回答所有问题
and always answer every question with, "Yes, Drill Sergeant!"



听明白了吗
Is that clear?



是  德尔中士
Yes, Drill Sergeant!



你只需要贴着海底拖渔网
What you do is, you just drag your nets along the bottom.



运气好的话  你一次就能捕到100多磅的虾
On a good day, you can catch over 100 pounds of shrimp.



如果一切顺利的话  两个人捕虾十个小时
If everything goes all right, two men shrimping 10 hours,

装完了  德尔中士

你为什么组装枪这么快  阿甘
Why did you put that weapon together so quickly, Gump?



你让我这么做的  德尔中士
You told me to, Drill Sergeant.



我的上帝  你创了本连的新纪录
Jesus H. Christ, this is a new company record.



要不是担心浪费了这么好的一个兵
If it wouldn't be a waste of such a damn fine enlisted man,



我真想推荐你去候补军官学校  二等兵甘
I'd recommend you for OCS, Private Gump.



你将来一定能成为一名将军  阿甘
You are gonna be a general some day, Gump.



现在拆开你的枪  重新组装
Now, disassemble your weapon and continue!



就像我刚刚说过的  虾就是大海结出的果实
Anyway, like I was saying, shrimp is the fruit of the sea.



你可以做烤虾  水煮虾  炒虾

虾肉汉堡  鲜虾三明治...
shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich...



差...差不多就这些了
That's... That's about it.



军队里的夜晚格外孤独
Night time in the Army is a lonely time.



我们会躺在床铺上
We'd lay there in our bunks



我会想念我妈妈
and I'd miss my mama.



我还会想念珍妮
And I'd miss Jenny.



阿甘 
Gump,



好好看看她的胸吧
get a load of the tits on her!



结果发现  珍妮惹上了一些麻烦
Turns out, Jenny had gotten into some trouble



因为她穿着校服拍了几张照片
over some photos of her in her college sweater,



所以她被学校开除了
and she was thrown out of school.



不过这也并非一件坏事
But that wasn't a bad thing,



因为一个在田纳西州孟菲斯有剧场的人
because a man who owns a theater in Memphis, Tennessee,



看到了那些照片 
saw those photos



然后给珍妮提供了一份登台唱歌的工作
and offered Jenny a job singing in a show.



我一有机会休假
The first chance I got,



就马上乘大巴去孟菲斯  去看她的表演
I took the bus up to Memphis to see her perform in that show.



刚刚表演的是安波  安波·弗莱姆
That was Amber, Amber Flame.



请大家为她热烈鼓掌  好样的  安波

但除了成箱的啤酒和野外烧烤外  的确如此

It wasn't always fun.



丹中尉总是

会对路上的风吹草动有着古怪的直觉
getting these funny feelings about a rock, or a trail, or the road,



然后他会叫我们趴下  闭嘴...
so he'd tell us to get down, shut up...



趴下  闭嘴
Get down! Shut up!



于是我们照做
...so we did.



虽然我对所有事情都不太懂

我有个非常重要的问题要问你
I got a very important question to ask you.



你想不想跟我一起做捕虾的行当
How would you like to go into the shrimping business with me?



好啊
Okay.



我告诉你  我也全都想清楚了
Man, I tell you what, I got it all figured out, too.



要捕多少磅虾才能付清买船的钱
So many pounds of shrimp to pay off the boat,



捕多少磅虾付油钱  我们可以直接住在船上
so many pounds for gas, we can just live right on the boat.



那样就不用交房租了
We ain't got to pay no rent.



我来当船长  我们可以合作
I'll be the captain, we can just work it together,



所有收入对半分
split everything right down the middle.



我告诉你  一人一半
Man, I'm telling you, 50-50.



弗里斯特  你想吃多少虾都有
And, hey, Forrest, all the shrimp you can eat.



那真是个好主意
That's a fine idea.



巴巴确实想出了个好主意
Bubba did have a fine idea.



我甚至写信给珍妮  把这事告诉了她
I even wrote Jenny and told her all about it.



我经常给她写信  虽不是每天都写  但也差不多了
I sent her letters, not every day, but almost.



我会告诉她我在做什么
I told her what I was doing



问她都在做什么
and asked her what she was doing,



告诉她我一直以来有多想她
and told her how I thought about her always,



以及我有多么期盼收到她的信
and how I was looking forward to getting a letter from her



前提是她有时间回信
just as soon as she had the time.



我总是让她知道我平安无事
I'd always let her know that I was okay.



然后在每封信的落款  我会写上
Then, I'd sign each letter,



"爱你的  弗里斯特·甘"
"Love, Forrest Gump."



有一天  我们走在外面  就像平常一样
This one day, we was out walking, like always,



然后  就这样

好像有人把雨关停了  太阳出来了
somebody turned off the rain and the sun come out.

我发现了一个男孩躺在地上

我不能任由他一个人躺在那里 
I couldn't just let him lay there all alone,



他惊魂未定  极度恐惧
scared the way he was,



所以我扛起他  带他跑了出去
so I grabbed him up and run him out of there.



每次我回去找巴巴时
And every time I went back looking for Bubba,



都有别人在喊  "救救我  弗里斯特  救救我"
somebody else was saying, "Help me, Forrest. Help me."



听不见  听不见
Can't hear... Can't hear...



别担心  兄弟  躺着就好
No sweat, man. Just lay back.



你会没事的  你会没事的
You'll be okay. You'll be okay.



我渐渐开始害怕我可能永远也找不到巴巴了
I started to get scared that I might never find Bubba.



完毕

巴巴教过我他所知的一切关于捕虾的知识

没有虾

that somebody would do all that running for no particular reason.



你为什么要这么做
Why are you doing this?



我就是想跑
I just felt like running.



我就是想跑
I just felt like running.



是你  没想到真的是你
It's you. I can't believe it's really you.



但现在  不知怎么的
Now, for some reason,



别人似乎能够理解我的行为了
what I was doing seemed to make sense to people.



我感觉  就像脑袋突然开窍了一样
I mean, it was like an alarm went off in my head, you know?



我说  「这家伙是个积极振作的人」
I said, "Here's a guy that's got his act together.



「这家伙参透了一切」
"Here's somebody who's got it all figured out.



「这家伙知晓人生答案」
"Here's somebody who has the answer."



无论你去哪里  我都跟着你  甘先生
I'll follow you anywhere, Mr. Gump.



于是就有人跟着我了
So, I got company.



之后  有了更多的人
And after that, I got more company.



再然后  更多的人加入了
And then, even more people joined in.



后来有人跟我说  这能给人希望
Somebody later told me it gave people hope.



不过  我对此倒是不是很明白
Now... Now, I don't know anything about that,



但其中有些人问我能不能帮助他们
but some of those people asked me if I could help them out.



嘿  老兄  不知道能不能请你帮个忙
Hey, man, hey, listen, I was wondering if you might help me, huh?



听着  我是生产车尾贴的
Listen, I'm in the bumper sticker business



我一直在努力想出一条好标语

因为你如此激励人心
And since you have been such a big inspiration



带动了这里的很多人
to the people around here,



我想着  也许你能帮我想一个标语
I thought you might be able to help me jump into...



天呐  你刚刚跑过了一堆狗屎

And some years later, I heard that that fellow



还真的想到了一条出色的车尾贴标语
did come up with a bumper sticker slogan,



还因此赚了很多钱
and he made a lot of money off of it.



{\an5}屎属正常



还有一次  跑步的时候
Another time, I was running along,



有人说他的T恤生意赔光了钱
somebody who had lost all his money in the T-shirt business,



他想把我的脸印在T恤上
he wanted to put my face on a T-shirt,



但他画画不好  又没有相机
but he couldn't draw that well, and he didn't have a camera.



给  用这个  反正也没人喜欢这个颜色
Here, use this one. Nobody likes that color anyway.



祝你愉快
Have a nice day.



很多年后
Well, some years later,



我发现那个人为T恤想到了好的创意图案
I found out that that man did come up with an idea for a T-shirt.



他因此赚了很多钱
He made a lot of money off of it.



总之  就像我说的
Anyway, like I was saying,



有很多人陪着我同行
I had a lot of company.



我妈妈生前常说
My mama always said,



「要想向前走  就得先放下过去」
"You got to put the past behind you before you can move on."



我觉得这就是我跑步的意义

我跑了三年  两个月

加14天16小时

And just like that,
