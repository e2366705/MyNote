 * @param {Function|Subject} subjectOrSubjectFactory - Factory function to create an intermediate Subject through
 * which the source sequence's elements will be multicast to the selector function input Observable or
 * ConnectableObservable returned by the operator.
 * @param {Function} [selector] - Optional selector function that can use the input stream
 * as many times as needed, without causing multiple subscriptions to the source stream.
 * Subscribers to the input source will receive all notifications of the source from the
 * time of the subscription
