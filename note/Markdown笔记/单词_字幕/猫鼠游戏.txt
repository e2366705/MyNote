It's... It's a note from my mom.



我和医生有个预约 
I have a doctor's appointment.



是的, 但是纸上没有折痕 
Yeah, but there's no crease in the paper.



当你妈给你这张条子来请假的时候... 
When your mom hands you a note to miss school



你首先干的就是, 你会折它
the first thing you do is, you fold it



然后你会把它放进你的口袋 
and you put it in your pocket.



我的意思是说, 如果是真的, 折痕在哪里?
I mean, if it's real, where's the crease?



弗兰克

爸在店里 
Dad's at the store.



啊, 弗兰克... 你看上去
So, Frank... you're getting to look



越来越像你老爸了啊 
more like your old man every day.



谢谢你的三文治, 保拉

待会儿见, 嗯? 
I'll see you all later, eh?



你饿吗, 弗兰克? 
Are you hungry, Frankie?



我会给你做份三明治的 
I'll make you a sandwich.



杰克想要和你爸谈些生意上的事 
Jack wanted to talk business with your father.



他认为我们需要请个律师, 向政府上诉 
He thinks we should get a lawyer and sue the government.



那是不合法的, 他们对我们做的那些
That is not legal, what they're doing to us.



你为什么不说话? 
Why aren't you saying anything?



你不会和他说的, 是吗? 
You're not going to tell him... are you?



不会 
No.



那就好了 
That's right.



也没什么可以说 
There's nothing to tell.



我会外出几个小时... 
I'm going out for a few hours



看一些网球俱乐部的老朋友... 
to visit some old friends from the tennis club and...



我回家后, 我们一起吃晚饭
when I get home, we'll all have dinner together.



行吗? 
Right?



但你不会说的... 
But you won't say anything



因为... 这是愚蠢的, 不是吗?
because it's... it's just silly, isn't it?



我们怎么告人呢? 
How could we sue anybody?



哦... 你需要一些钱吗, 弗兰克? 
Oh... do you need some money, Frankie?



买点唱片什么的? 
A few dollars to buy some record albums?

They're all waiting for you.



你不需要恐惧 
You don't have to be scared.



我在这, 弗兰克 我一直到会在这儿
I'm right here, Frank. I'll always be here.



但那是法律 
But there are laws.



这个国家的任何事都要合法 
Everything in this country has to be legal.



所以我们要做的 只是做几个决定
So what we need to do is make some decisions.



就是这个原因凯森先生才会在这儿的 
That's what Mr. Kesner is here for.



很多时候这些问题都可以留给法院 
Many times these decisions are left up to the courts



但是那样很昂贵, 弗兰克 
but that can be very expensive, Frank



为了孩子而争斗 
people fighting over their children.



没有人在争斗

弗兰克, 你不需要读这些 
Frank, you don't have to read all of this.



这些都是关于你父母的... 无聊的成人的事...
Most of it's for your parents... boring adult business...



但是这里面的一段, 这是重要的...
but this paragraph right here, this is important



因为这关系到你要和谁一起住... 
because it states who you're gonna live with...



离婚后...

我想见到一个名字在那条线上 
I want to see a name on that line.



弗兰克, 只要写下一个名字 然后就结束了

都会好的 
It's gonna be okay.
