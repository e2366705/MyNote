有一次我翘了课  路过玛莲娜的房子
Once I skipped school and went by Malena's house.



她在窗边  喊我过去
She was at the window, and she called out to me.



我以为她要让我帮忙买烟
I thought she wanted me to get her some cigarettes.



我去拿钱  结果她的睡袍散了
I went up for the money, and her robe fell open.



就那样  赤身裸体的站在那里
And there she was... naked as the day she was born.



我的天  她一定是故意诱惑我的
Holy shit! She did it on purpose to excite me.



我太傻了  早知道有机会就上了
I was an idiot. I should have jumped at the chance.



再给我一次机会  我肯定操翻她
If it happens again, I'll bang her brains out.



首先  她会戒烟的  她已经知道你没色胆了
She'd quit smoking first. She knows you've got no balls.

I sewed it 20 years ago, and it still looks brand-new.



他只在结婚的时候穿过  他想留着葬礼穿
He only wore it to his wedding. He wants to keep it for his funeral.



如果他穿着这个下葬  那就直接进天堂了
If he's buried in this suit, he'll go straight to heaven!



我爸还年轻
My father's still young.



而你也太年轻了  不能穿长裤
And you're too young for long pants.



我没问你的意见  先生
I didn't ask for your opinion, sir.



- 他知道吗  - 他当然知道
- Does he know about this? - Of course he does!



你个小坏蛋  这是怎么搞的
You little scoundrel, what the hell is this?

你还让你朋友打了一顿
And you let your friends beat you up.



我当年像你这么大的时候  只有我揍别人的份
Even though when I was your age, I'd beat my friends up!



但你竟敢从你爸这里偷裤子
But stealing trousers from your father...



还拿去改了自己穿  这就大错特错了
and getting them altered for yourself is just plain wrong.



可是爸爸  你不明白
But, Papa, you don't understand!



不明白  谁让你说话了
Understand? Who said you could speak?



我现在还穿短裤  很丢脸
I'm ashamed to wear short pants!



灯笼裤呢  那基本算是长裤了
What about knickers? They're almost long pants!



够了  他还小啊
Enough! He's still a child!



我要去告诉党支部书记  你不让我参加法西斯训练
I'll tell our party secretary you won't let me go to the Fascist exercises!



我们定个约
Let's make a deal.



哪天有人把咱伟大的领袖打爆头
The day someone cracks the skull of "Our Great Leader,"



你就能穿长裤了
then you'll get long pants.



你发誓
Swear it.



这么年轻漂亮的女人独身一人  真是罪过
A beautiful young woman all alone here. It's a crime.



- 他说谁呢  - 玛莲娜·斯克迪亚  尼诺的性感老婆

她枕边一定有别人  肯定的
She must have somebody on the side... it's inevitable!



- 十五号  - 我

尼诺从她镇里把她和她那耳朵不好使的爸爸一起接来
Right. Nino brings her from her village with her ailing father.



结果一个月之后  砰  尼诺上战场了
And then a month later... boom... Nino's called to the war.



谁敢打赌她不跟别人睡
Who here wants to bet she's sleeping all alone?



我才不打呢
Not me!



为什么我不能跟他们坐一起
Why don't you let me sit with the others?



你还太小  不能坐大人的椅子
You're too young to sit in the adult chair.

挤进她的腿咯
He fits in between her legs!



太丢脸了  她爸都辞掉了老师的工作
Her father was forced to quit the school in disgrace.



他再也不想见他女儿玛莲娜了
He never wants to see his daughter Malena again.



牙医的老婆也把他踢出了家门
And the dentist's wife kicked him out of his house.



妻子一怒之下肯定会把他告上法庭
That dragon of a wife will drag him into court!



牙医又有什么错呢  可怜的家伙
What's the dentist got to do with it, poor guy?



是玛莲娜那个婊子  她才该被抓起来
Malena's the whore! She should be taken to court!



凯迪上尉看起来那么正派
That Lt. Cadei seemed like such a gentleman.



怎么掺合进来的
How could he get mixed up in this?



大家都知道她就是个小三
Everyone knows she's a home wrecker.



上尉自找的
The lieutenant was asking for it!



- 她都不是这儿的人  忘记了自己的地位  - 他们会上法庭吗
- She's not from here. She forgets where she is. - Will they go to court?



当然了  她也许会坐牢的  他可是有妇之夫
Of course, she could go to jail. He's a married man!



牙医头上要缝三针呢
The dentist needed three stitches in his head.



但是牙医先骂的上尉啊
But the dentist swore at the soldier first.



冒犯了长官
That's insulting an officer.



法庭会带给我们答案的
We'll all end up in court!



当我们还在远处看着她的时候
While we were watching her caboose,



中尉和牙医已经跟她搞上了
the lieutenant and the dentist were riding the train!



她还去过律师跟公证人那儿
She's either going to the lawyer's or the notary's.



没错  但那两个男人那么老  她能干嘛

你被指控和牙医加西帕·库西马诺

你现在  或者之前  做过他的未婚妻吗

为什么库西马诺在那么晚的时候
Why was Cusimano, at that unusual hour...



要去你家里呢
on his way to your house?

I don't know.



你们以前发生过夜晚共处的情况吗
Had he been in your company on previous evenings?



是的  一次

你们做了什么
What did you do?



他给我带了我父亲的药

我不知道
I don't know.



他给你药之后呢  你们又做了什么
What did you do after he gave you the medicine?



他说了声再见就走了

那为什么库西马诺  这位曾经
Then why has Cusimano, are put able professional,



在五年前
who, five years ago...



给领袖拔过牙的资深牙科专家
had the honor of extracting one of II Duce's teeth...



在公众场合声称他是你的未婚夫
publicly declare that he is your fiance?



他胡扯的  我跟这一点关系都没有
He made that up. I had nothing to do with it.



你丈夫真胆大
Your husband's crazy.



你和凯迪中尉是什么关系

干掉了一个

在他离开之前  也接受了法庭的讯问
And before his departure, he was questioned in judicial inquiry.



读给她听
Clerk.



他声称他以前只在寡妇斯克迪亚家
He declared to have encountered



见过她两次
the widow Scordia only twice... in her home,



并且没有发生非正当关系
and to have had no amorous relationship...



他认为他们的关系  仅仅是普通朋友
considering their relationship "just a casual friendship."



贱人
Son of a bitch.



凯迪中尉收到了我的委托人的信件
Lt. Cadei was received by my client...



她毫不隐瞒她对中尉的
and she makes no secret about having had for him...



特殊感觉
certain feelings.



但不像已婚的库西马诺
But unlike the married Cusimano,



看看他吧  我就直说了
who was, let's face it, guilty...



看看这张因为纵欲过度而导致早衰
of a pre-senile dimming of the senses...



且写满罪恶的脸
of an intoxicating kaleidoscope of desires...



不像有家室的库西马诺
Unlike the family man Cusimano, But...



凯迪现在是
Cadei is...



以前也是
and was...



单身汉  一个单身汉
a bachelor... a bachelor!



聪明啊  那个律师
Clever, that lawyer.



他本身就是单身汉
He's a bachelor himself.



仔细调查就会发现事实真相  因此
Careful investigation of the facts tell us, therefore...



斯克迪亚没有罪过
that the Scordia woman committed no other crime...



只有悲惨的命运
than that of being ill-fated,



孤独又美丽
alone and beautiful.



她唯一的罪过便是  她的美丽
Here is her crime: Her beauty!



正因为如此  嫉妒
And from here, the envy,



谎言  耻辱
the lies, the disgrace,



使她一无所有  甚至剥夺了她父亲的信任
that have deprived her even of a father's trust!



可是  她仍处在无声的痛苦里

向那远在东非的战死沙场之人的
mourning over that unmarked war grave...



无名墓冢哀悼
in faraway East Africa.



我们辩论的中心内容
In the beating heart of our argument...



是一个如此大胆却又合情合理的观点
is an audacious, but nonetheless valid, thesis...



我想请问
which asks just one question:



一个这样的少妇
Can a young woman...



在爱的国度里寡居了这么久之后
after the odyssey of a widowhood endured for the love of country...



在新生活中寻求庇护有错吗
hope for protection in the shelter of a new life?



她难道没有权利去追求  去谱写
Does she have the right to yearn for, and to write...



一个属于她的  全新的爱情故事吗
a new ending to her own love story?



法官大人
Your Honor,



卡斯特库托的居民们都回答  是的
the citizens of Castelcuto reply: "Yes!"



库西马诺不会再来烦我了吧
Will Cusimano leave me alone now?



当然不会  他被送进精神病院了
Of course. He's been put into a psychiatric clinic.



他要志愿参加东非作战
He wants to volunteer for the Forces in East Africa.



他还没意识到我们几年前就失去非洲了
He doesn't realize we lost Africa ages ago!



让我们忘了库西马诺和凯迪中尉吧
But let's forget Cusimano and the fickle Lt. Cadei.



这儿只有我们
Let's get to us!



我知道这不多
I know it's not much.



但我只有这么多了  他们克扣了我的抚恤金
But it's all I have. They've cut my pension.



你不明白吗

钱是小事
That's peanuts!



我的律师费远不止这些
My fee is much more than that.



你永远都付不起的
You'll never have enough money!



那我怎么偿还你
But how will I ever repay you?



很简单  我的甜心
It's very easy, my sweet.



- 你说什么  - 和我在一起  亲爱的
- What are you saying? - Be with me, my love!



我好爱你啊
I'm in love with you!



在这艰难的年头  一个女人不应该单身独处
A woman shouldn't be alone during these hard times.



我有的是钱  你找不到更好的人了
I am a wealthy man. You won't find better.



我可以照顾你父亲  你再也不用担心了
I'll take care of your father. You'll never have to worry again.



我原谅她  她是为了付律师费
I forgive her. She did it to pay her lawyer's fees



但只此一次  下不为例
only once and never again.



但你没有遵守我们的契约
But you didn't keep our agreement.
