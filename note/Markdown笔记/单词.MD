记短句，比长句有效率

英语笑话:
How do you keep your violin from getting stolen? 
（怎么防止你的小提琴被偷窃？）

写一个程序，不停的在屋子里循环播放英语单词和翻译
（或者英语短句和翻译），起到洗脑的效果

Erotic novel

可以选择单词的长度【3个字母的单词】

English article 「每句话占用一行 配有每句话的翻译，每个单词的翻译」 

可以自定义的增加/修改/删除短句

Web需求：打字时候，自动提示补全

查出单词的使用频率，减少记忆成本（谷歌翻译有词频）

支持搜索功能（英文单词和中文意思智能搜索）

编程语言【Java，Python，C，php】中的英文关键字

扇贝单词里面的网友笔记，
很值得借鉴，
因为有很多的巧记方法，

有些单词的中文意思，使用频率非常低，
几乎不用，所以就没必要记了，
减少记忆负担（Google翻译词频）

今日单词【固定的一些单词，一天内不会变，每天不一样】
【可以自定义每天要记的单词的个数，每天20个？30个？40个？】
完全掌握按钮
【点击了安全掌握按钮，这个单词下次就再也不会出现】

有些单词，单纯的翻译单个单词不好翻译，
必须结合一句话的语境来感受这个单词的意思，
所以说，这又是另外一种记忆方式

找一篇英文文章
找出所有的陌生单词
然后先是记单词
然后再去看文章
这样效率好一点

实现一个算法：多次点击「不认识」
按钮的单词，归类为疑难单词，
比如：violate 多次点击了不记得按钮，
后台程序自动归类为疑难单词，方便复习

一个单词 什么复数啊，
过去式啊，
将来时啊（最高反义词也给搭上）
……都爬取出来

有些单词不止一个意思，
有好几个不同的意思（多义词），这就很麻烦了……
比如：
Composition 组成 作文 
tank 坦克 箱
两种意思


有些单词，中文意思太繁琐了，
比如：【despite 尽管，虽然】
尽管和虽然，意思相近，但是我们记单词的时候却要记2个
增加了记忆负担，这样效率大大下降
所以，只需要记忆其中一个中文意思就足够了

你知道他是你妻子的情人
... whom you had discovered was your wife's lover.



你跟踪她了吗？
Did you follow her?



我先去了几间酒吧找
I went to a few bars first.



接着，我开车去了昆汀家，但他们不在家里
Later, I drove to his house to confront them. They weren't home.

I parked in the turnout...



等在那里
... and waited.



有何企图吗？

在回家的路上，我把枪扔进了河里
Along the way, I threw my gun into the Royal River.

I get hazy where the cleaning woman shows up the following morning...

...and finds your wife in bed with her lover...



致死的子弹是出自点38口径的手枪
...riddled with.38-caliber bullets.

Does that strike you as a fantastic coincidence, or is it just me?



确实是巧合
Yes, it does.



你仍坚持说你在凶案发生前
Yet you still maintain you threw your gun into the river...



已经把枪扔进河里了吗？
...before the murders took place.



这对你很有利
That's very convenient.



这是事实
It's the truth.



警察在河里找了三天，但他们没有找到你的枪……
The police dragged that river for three days, and nary a gun was found...



所以无法鉴定
...so no comparison could be made between your gun and the bullets...



死者身上的子弹是否出自你的枪

... as to merit a death sentence?



当你们考虑时
While you think about that...



请想想这个……
...think about this:



一个弹匣只能装六颗子弹，而不是八颗
A revolver holds six bullets, not eight.



我肯定这不只是一时冲动而犯下的罪行
I submit that this was not a hot-blooded crime of passion.



那至少是可以理解的，即使不能宽恕
That at least could be understood, if not condoned.



不！
No.



这是复仇
This was revenge...



一个冷血者的复仇，看看这些：
...of a much more brutal, cold-blooded nature. Consider this:



每个死者都身中四枪
Four bullets per victim.



总共是八枪而不是六枪
Not six shots fired, but eight.



那表明子弹打完后
That means that he fired the gun empty...



他还停下来装子弹
... and then stopped to reload...



以便再次向他们开枪
... so that he could shoot each of them again.



每人多加一枪
An extra bullet per lover...



就在头部
... right in the head.

-是的，先生 -你感到后悔吗？
- Yes, sir. - You feel you've been rehabilitated?



是的，绝对有，先生
Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.



我是说，我得到了教训
I mean, I learned my lesson.



我敢说我已经完全改变了
I can honestly say that I'm a changed man.



我不会再危害社会
I'm no longer a danger to society.



这是神的真理

Fine morning, isn't it?



你们知道我的意思的，对吗？
You know why it's a fine morning, don't you?



把它们拿出来，把它们排成排……

Yes! Richmond, Virginia.



闻我的屁吧
Smell my ass!



再闻闻我的
After he smells mine.

That's a shame about your horse coming in last and all.



但我很喜欢我下注的那个人
But I sure do love that winning horse of mine, though.



我见到他就要亲他一下
I owe that boy a big kiss when I see him.



你为何不把香烟分给他点？
Why don't you give him some of your cigarettes instead? Lucky fuck!

这儿每个人都是无辜的，你不知道吗？
Everybody in here's innocent. Didn't you know that?



-你为进监狱？ -我什么都没做，律师害了我

你能给我个鹤嘴槌吗？
I wonder if you might get me a rock hammer.



鹤嘴槌
A rock hammer.



-要干什么？ -你关心这个干吗？
- What is it and why? - What do you care?



如果是牙刷我就不会问你，我会开个价钱
For a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask. I'd quote a price.



但是牙刷没有杀伤力，对吗？
But a toothbrush is a non-lethal object, isn't it?



有道理
Fair enough.



一个鹤嘴槌有六至七英寸长
A rock hammer is about six or seven inches long.



-看起来像个小锄子 -锄子？
- Looks like a miniature pickax. - Pickax?



打石用的
For rocks.



-石英 -石英？
Quartz?



还有云母、页岩……

这么说吧
So?



我收集石头

不会？等着瞧吧
No? Wait a while.



话说回来

那对姐妹花很喜欢你
The Sisters have taken quite a liking to you.



特别是伯格斯
Especially Bogs.



就算跟他们说我不好此道也没用
Don't suppose it would help if I told them I'm not homosexual.



他们也不是
Neither are they.



是这个地方让他们这样
You have to be human first. They don't qualify.



畜牲只知道用暴力，不管他人喜不喜欢
Bull queers take by force. That's all they want or understand.



如果我是你，我会加倍小心
If I were you, I'd grow eyes in the back of my head.

- Thanks for the advice. - Well, that's free.



你知道我担心什么
You understand my concern.



就算我有麻烦也不会用鹤嘴槌的

But this is a specialty item.



风险越大，价钱越高，一口价，10元吧
Risk goes up, price goes up. Let's make it an even 10 bucks.



就10元吧
Ten it is.



你那是浪费钱
Waste of money, if you ask me.



为什么？

这里的人喜欢突击检查
Folks around this joint love surprise inspections.



他们找到鹤嘴槌就会被充公

Mention my name, we never do business again.



Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum. Now you got that?



我知道了
I understand.



谢谢你，你叫……
Thank you, Mr...



瑞德
Red.



都叫我瑞德
Name's Red.



这名字怎么来的？
Why do they call you that?



可能因为我是半个爱尔兰人吧
Maybe it's because I'm Irish.



我现在明白他们为何看中他了
I could see why some of the boys took him for snobby.



他不太说话
He had a quiet way about him...



一举一动都不像普通的人
... a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here.



他漫步着
He strolled...



就像在公园里散步
... like a man in the park without a care or a worry in the world.



像穿了件隐形的外套
Like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place.



可以说
I think it'd be fair to say...



开始我对安迪就有好感
... I liked Andy from the start.



快点！我赶时间的
Let's go! Some of us got a schedule to keep.



快点
Move it! Come on, move it!



你太太对你好吗？
How you doing? How's the wife treating you?



安迪说得很对
Andy was right.



我最终拿到那玩意
I finally got the joke.



用这东西来挖隧道
It would take a man about 600 years...



起码要花六百年

漂白粉不够用了，你再去后面拿点来
We're running low on hexite. Get on back and fetch us up some.



这可以弄瞎你的眼睛
This will blind you.



亲爱的
Honey, hush.



你不懂
That's it. You fight!



你越挣扎越过瘾
Better that way.



我很想说安迪打赢了
I wish I could tell you Andy fought the good fight...



或者姐妹花放过了他
... and the Sisters let him be.



我希望能这么说
I wish I could tell you that...



但是监狱不是童话世界
... but prison is no fairy-tale world.



他从没提起是谁
He never said who did it.



但我们都很清楚
But we all knew.



事情就这样持续了一段时间
Things went on like that for a while.



监狱里的生活都是常规
Prison life consists of routine...



和更多的常规
... and then more routine.



安迪的脸上经常出现新的伤痕
Every so often, Andy would show up with fresh bruises.



姐妹花不断地骚扰他
The Sisters kept at him.



有时候他能逃脱
Sometimes he was able to fight them off.



但有时不能
Sometimes not.



对安迪来说
And that's how it went for Andy.



这已经成了他的常规
That was his routine.



我相信最初的两年是最糟糕的
I do believe those first two years were the worst for him.



我也相信事情再继续这样下去
And I also believe that if things had gone on that way...



这个地方会夺去他的精神
... this place would have got the best of him.



但是，在1949年的春天
But then, in the spring of 1949...



上头决定……
... the powers that be decided:



工厂的屋顶需要重修
The roof of the license-plate factory needs resurfacing.



我需要12名自愿者工作一星期
I need a dozen volunteers for a week's work.



你们知道的
As you know...



特殊的工作有特殊的好处
...special detail carries with it special privileges.



这是户外劳动
It was outdoor detail...



五月是户外劳动的好时间
... and May is one damned fine month to be working outdoors.



排好队
Stay in line there.



超过100人报名参加劳动
More than a hundred men volunteered for the job.



威勒斯·E·安戈……
Wallace E. Unger.



艾力斯·瑞丁……
Ellis Redding.



你明白了吧？
Wouldn't you know it?



我和几个我认识的都被选中了
Me and some fellows I know were among the names called.



安迪·德福瑞恩……
Andrew Dufresne.



这只花了我们每人一包烟的代价
It only cost us a pack of smokes per man.



我当然也像往常一样赚了20%
I made my usual 20 percent, of course.



德州的律师打长途给我
So this big-shot lawyer calls me long-distance from Texas.



我说，“喂？”
I say, "Yeah?"



他说，“很遗憾，你哥哥死了”
He says, " Sorry to inform you, but your brother just died."



-我很难过 -我并不难过，他是个混蛋
- I'm sorry to hear that. - I'm not. He was an asshole.



离家多年，早就当他死了
Ran off years ago. Figured him for dead.



这个律师对我说
So this lawyer fellow says to me:



“他死的时候很富有”，有价值超过百万的油井
"He died a rich man." Oil wells and shit. Close to a million bucks.



超过百万的？
A million bucks?



-有些混蛋的运气有时候就是好 -有你的份吗？
- Incredible how lucky some assholes get. - You going to see any of that?



三万五千块 那就他留给我的
Thirty-five thousand. That's what he left me.



-美元？ -对
Dollars?



真不错，就像中了彩
That's great! That's like winning the sweepstakes.



不是吗？
Isn't it?



笨蛋，你想政府会如何对我？
Dumb shit, what do you think the government will do to me?



他们会拿去一大半
Take a big wet bite out of my ass is what.



可怜的布朗
Poor Byron.



真是走运，嗯？奇耻大辱
Terrible fucking luck, huh? Crying shame.



有些人觉得很糟糕
Some people really got it awful.



安迪，你傻了吗？
Andy, are you nuts?



看着你的拖把，嘿！
IKeep your eyes on your mop, man!



虽然要交点税，但你还可以……
You'll pay some tax, but you'll still end up...



也许够买辆新车，但接着呢？
Yeah, maybe enough to buy a new car, and then what?



你必须为新车上该死的税，维修和保养
I got to pay tax on the car. Repair...



孩子们会缠着你带着他们兜风
...maintenance, kids pestering you to take them for a ride all the time.



如果年底算错了税金，还要掏自己的腰包
Then if you figure your tax wrong, you pay out of your own pocket.



告诉你！山姆叔叔
I tell you! Uncle Sam!



他只是假仁假义
He puts his hand in your shirt and squeezes your tit till it's purple.



他在找死，继续干活吧
- Getting himself killed. - IKeep tarring.



什么兄弟，呸！
Some brother. Shit!



哈德利先生
Mr. Hadley...



你信任你太太吗？
...do you trust your wife?



噢，这很有趣
Oh, that's funny.



你给我挨揍的话也许更有趣
You'll look funnier sucking my dick with no teeth.



我是说，你是否会认为她对你不忠？
What I mean is, do you think she'd go behind your back?



让开点，米特，让他自己出意外
Step aside, Mert. This fucker's having himself an accident.



他会把他推下去的
He'll push him off!



如果你信任她，你就能……
If you trust her, you can keep...



……拿到三万五千元
...that 35,000.



-你说什么？ -三万五千元
- What did you say? - Thirty-five thousand.



一分不少
All of it.



你最好说明白点，小子，不然你完蛋了
- Every penny. - You better start making sense.



你要拿到这笔钱的话，就把它送给你妻子
If you want to keep it, give it to your wife.



政府允许一次性赠与配偶金额的上限是六万美元
The IRS allows a one-time-only gift to your spouse for up to $ 60,000.



-胡扯！免税的吗？ -免税的
- Bullshit. Tax-free? - Tax-free.



国税局一毛钱也拿不走
IRS can't touch one cent.



你是那个谋杀妻子的银行家吗？
You're that smart banker that killed his wife.



我为何要相信你？
Why should I believe you? So I can end up in here with you?



这是合法的，你可以去问国税局，他们会给你同样的回答
It's legal. Ask the IRS. They'll say the same thing.



我知道即使我不告诉你，你也能查到的
I feel stupid telling you this. I'm sure you would have investigated.



我不需要你来教我怎么做
I don't need you to tell me where the bear shit in the buckwheat.



当然，但你需要有人帮你逃税
Of course not. But you do need someone to set it up for you.



你需要请一个律师
That'll cost you. A lawyer.



那些华盛顿的混蛋？
A bunch of ball-washing bastards!



我想我能帮你，那你就能省点钱
I suppose I could set it up for you. That would save you some money.



我帮你填好文件
You get the forms, I'll prepare them...



几乎是免费的
...nearly free of charge.



我只要求给每个同事三瓶啤酒
I'd only ask three beers apiece for each of my coworkers.



同事？你真的发达了
"Coworkers." That's rich!



一个户外工作的人能有啤酒喝的话
A man working outdoors feels more like a man...



……会感觉更像一个男人，那是我的意见……
...if he can have a bottle of suds. That's only my opinion...



长官
...sir.



你们在看什么？
What are you jimmies staring at?



继续干活
Let's go! Work!



就这样
And that's how it came to pass...



在完工前的第二天
... that on the second-to-last day of the job...



在49年的春天里，一群在工厂上面装修的罪犯
... the convict crew that tarred the factory roof in the spring of '49...



早上十点坐在屋顶上
... wound up sitting in a row at 10:00 in the morning...



享受着清凉的啤酒和肖申克最严密的保护
... drinking icy-cold beer, courtesy of the hardest screw...



这种事在肖申克从没有发生
... that ever walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison.



趁凉喝，女士们。
Drink up while it's cold, ladies.



他还装作很大度似的走来走去
The colossal prick even managed to sound magnanimous.



我们坐着喝着啤酒，阳光洒在肩头，觉得是个自由人
We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders and felt like free men.



感觉就像在装修自己家的屋项
We could have been tarring the roof of one of our own houses.



我们就像造物主
We were the lords of all creation.



安迪看起来
As for Andy...



也有点不同了
... he spent that break hunkered in the shade...



他脸上露出奇怪的笑容
... a strange little smile on his face...



望着我们喝他的啤酒
... watching us drink his beer.



要来点吗？
Want a cold one?



不，谢谢，我戒酒了
No, thanks. I gave up drinking.



如果他不和狱警打交道
You could argue he done it to curry favor with the guards.



或许就不能和我们交上朋友
Or maybe make a few friends among us cons.



我？
Me?



我觉得他这样做只是为了在此感到自由
I think he did it just to feel normal again...



哪怕只是一小会儿
... if only for a short while.



将军
IKing me.



象棋，这是一个王者的游戏，什么？
- Chess. Now there's a game of kings. - What?



文明，战略
Civilized. Strategic.



我一点都没察觉，我讨厌这样
And a total fucking mystery. I hate it.



改天我教教你吧
Let me teach you someday.



好的
Sure.



或许你我可合作
We could get a board together.



你找对人了，我能弄到很多东西
You're talking to the right man. I can get things, right?



我们可以合作做买卖，我来雕刻
We might do business on a board, and I'll carve the pieces myself.



一面是石膏像，另一面是肥皂石，你觉得怎样？
One side in alabaster, one in soapstone. What do you think?



这需要很多时间
I think it'll take years.



时间不是问题，只是没有石头
Years I got. What I don't have are the rocks.



操场里拾到的都是小石头
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.



大多是鹅卵石
Pebbles, mostly.



安迪，我们是朋友，对吗？
We're getting to be kind of friends, aren't we?



我想是的
Yeah, I guess.



我能问你个问题吗？
Can I ask you something?



你为何要杀你妻子？
Why'd you do it?



我是清白的，瑞德
I'm innocent, Red.



就像这狱中其他人一样
Just like everybody else here.



你怎会进来的？
What are you in for?



和你一样，是谋杀
Murder. Same as you.



清白的？
Innocent?



肖申克监狱里唯一有罪的一个

金丝雀在哪里？

在我家听到女人唱歌很惊讶是吗？
Quite a surprise to hear a woman singing in my house, eh?



那确实令我……
That's quite a...



很惊讶
... surprise.



等等
Wait, wait.



她出场了
Here she comes.



我最爱看她摆弄头发那场戏
I like this part when she does that shit with her hair.



我知道，这个月已经看了三遍了

天啊，我喜欢这场戏
God, I love it.



我明白你什么都弄得到

Can you get her?



你就是强尼吗，久闻大名了
So this is Johnny Farrel. I've heard a lot about you.

谢谢

让我们做个了结吧

他打爆了我的鼻子
He broke my fucking nose!



现在
Now...



我要拉开拉链
...I'm going to open my fly...



我给你什么吃你就吃下什么
...and you'll swallow what I give you to swallow.



然后再吃罗斯的，你打爆了他的鼻子
Then you'll swallow Rooster's. You broke his nose.



他该得到点补偿
He ought to have something to show for it.



我会咬断任何放进我嘴里的东西
You put it in my mouth, you lose it.



不，你还没明白
No, you don't understand.



你那样做的话我就把刀插进你的耳朵
Do that and I'll put all eight inches of this in your ear.



好吧，但你得知道突如其来的脑部撞击
All right, but you should know that sudden, serious brain injury...



会令受害人剧烈反应
...causes the victim to bite down hard.



事实上，我听说受害者会咬紧牙关
In fact, I hear the bite reflex is so strong...



要用铁棍
...they have to pry the victim's jaws open...



才能撬开他的嘴巴
...with a crowbar.



你怎么知道的？
Where do you get this shit?



从书里看到的
I read it.



你不会看书？白痴？
You know how to read, you ignorant fuck?

Honey!



你不应该这样的
You shouldn't!



伯格斯没有把任何东西放进安迪的嘴里

之后，有两件事再也没发生过了

姐妹花再也不敢惹安迪了
The Sisters never laid a finger on Andy again.



而伯格斯再也没有站起来

他被送到一个特殊医院去
They transferred him to a minimum-security hospital upstate.



据我所知，他在下半生中……
To my knowledge, he lived out the rest of his days...



都只能靠饮筒来进食
... drinking his food through a straw.



我想给安迪开个欢迎会庆祝他复原
Andy could use a nice welcome back when he gets out of the infirmary.



听起来很不错
Sounds good to us.



啤酒的事我们还欠他的情

杰克，布鲁斯呢？
Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks?



安迪，我听到你来了

我知道，他们跟我说了

名字写在这板上

我1905年入狱，1912年在此工作
I come here in '05, and they made me librarian in 1912.

德福瑞恩



就是他
That's him. That's the one.



我叫迪格斯
I'm Dekins.



我想……
I was thinking...



为儿子申请助学金
...about setting up some kind of trust fund for my kids' educations.



我明白了
I see.



坐下来谈好吗？
Why don't we have a seat and talk it over.



布鲁斯，你有纸和笔吗？
Do you have a piece of paper and a pencil?



谢谢
Thanks.



那么
So...



迪格斯先生
Mister Dekins...



接着安迪问迪格斯
And then Andy says, " Mr. Dekins...



你想让你的儿子去哈佛还是耶鲁？
...do you want your sons to go to Harvard or Yale?"



他没有这样说
He didn't say that!



上帝可以作证
As God as my witness!



迪格斯愣了一会儿
Dekins blinked for a second...



傻笑着和安迪握手
...then he laughed and actually shook Andy's hand.



老天！和他握手
- My ass! - Shook his hand.



我告诉你们，我感到……
I tell you, I near soiled myself!



安迪若穿上那套衣服
All he needed was a suit and tie and a jiggly hula gal on his desk...



他就会变成德福瑞恩先生的了
...he'd have been "Mr. Dufresne," if you please.



安迪，又交上新朋友了？
Making a few friends?



我不认为是朋友
I wouldn't say "friends."



我是一个能提供准确财政计划的谋杀犯
I'm a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning.



只是某人不错的仆人
It's a wonderful pet to have.



至少可以令你离开洗衣房
Got you out of the laundry, though.



可能不是那么简单的
It might do more than that.



我打算扩大图书馆，找点新书
How about expanding the library. Get some new books.



还是找张台球桌吧
If you ask for something, ask for a pool table.



你打算怎么做，我是说
How do you expect to do that? I mean...



怎么得到新书，向谁请求
...get new books in here, "Mr. Dufresne, if you please."



我会向典狱长要钱
I'll ask the warden for funds.



噢，孩子，孩子，我经历了六个典狱长，懂得了一条
Six wardens have been through here in my tenure, and I've learned...



一个事实，宇宙真理
...one immutable, universal truth:



那个人还没有生出来
Not one born whose asshole...



你向他们提出定遭拒绝的
...wouldn't pucker up tighter than a snare drum when you ask for funds.



-预算不够用 -我知道
- The budget's stretched thin as it is. - I see.



或许我写信向参议员提出
Maybe I could write the state senate and request funds from them.



只有三种情况能动纳税人的钱
They have only three ways to spend the taxpayers' money for prisons:



多建围墙、多建牢房和增加监狱
More walls, more bars, more guards.



若你批准，我想尝试一下，每周一封信
I'd like to try, with permission. A letter a week.



-他们不能永不理会 -当然能够
- They can't ignore me forever. - Sure can.



如果你写着高兴那就写吧
But you write your letters if it makes you happy.



我来替你寄出，怎样？
I'll even mail them for you. How's that?



就这样，安迪开始每周写一封信
So Andy started writing a letter a week...



就像他说得那样
... just like he said.



但如诺顿所说
And like Norton said...



一直都无回覆
... Andy got no answers.



过了四月，安迪已帮半数狱警们报税
The following April, he did tax returns for half the guards at Shawshank.



后来，全都找他帮忙了
Year after that, he did them all...



连典狱长纳税务都由他处理
... including the warden's.



后来，他们安排
Year after that, they rescheduled the intramural season...



球队在税季中比赛
... to coincide with tax season.



所有的球队都带着报税表
The guards on the opposing teams all remembered to bring their W-2s.



所以莫尔斯比监狱……
So Moresby Prison...



配给你一支枪，但要你自己付钱
...issued you a gun, but you paid for it.



对，连手枪皮套也是
Right. The holster too.



那可以减免税款，你可把它记下来
That's tax-deductible. You can write that off.



是的！安迪就像一个正常的会计师
Yes, sir! Andy was a regular cottage industry.



事实上，在税季中他如此的忙，允许有一个帮手
In fact, it got so busy at tax time, he was allowed a staff.



瑞德，你可以取1040号表格来吗？
Could you hand me a stack of 1040s?



每年有一个月离开监狱去木工场做工
Got me out of the wood shop a month out of the year, and that was fine by me.



同时，安迪仍旧不断的写信
And still, he kept sending those letters.



安迪、瑞德，布鲁斯出事了
It's Brooks.



看着门
Watch the door.



冷静点，布鲁斯
Please, Brooks.



千万别冲动，放下来！
- Calm the fuck down. - Stay back!



-放下来，该死！ -发生什么事？
- Stay back, goddamn it! - What's going on?



他突然掏出刀来
One second he's fine, then out come the knives.



有事慢慢商量好吗？
We can talk about this, right?



没商量余地的，我要割断他的喉咙
There's nothing to talk about. I'll cut his fucking throat.



他有什么对不起你？
What's he done to you?



去问狱警吧
It's what they done!



我别无选择
I got no choice.



我们都知道，你不会伤害海伍德的
You won't hurt Heywood. We all know that.



-对吗，海伍德？ -是的
- Right, Heywood? - Sure.



他是你的朋友，布鲁斯是讲道理的
He's a friend of yours, and Brooks is a reasonable man.



对吗？
Right, guys?



那么把刀放下，看着我
So put the knife down. Look at me.



把刀放下
Put the knife down.



看看他的脖子
Look at his neck, for God's sake.



看看他的脖子，他在流血
Look at his neck. He's bleeding.



这是唯一
It's the only way...



使我留在这里的办法
...they'd let me stay.



你疯了，你不会这样做的
This is crazy. You don't want to do this.



放下，放下刀
Put it, put it down.



放松
Take it easy.



一切都会好的
You'll be all right.



他？那么我呢？
Him? What about me?



这个愚蠢的疯子差点割断我的喉咙
Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat!



你就连刮胡子也比这刮得厉害
You've had worse from shaving.



究竟怎么会这样？
What did you do to set him off?



没什么，我只是进来和他道别
Nothing. I come in here to say farewell.



难到你没听说？他获得假释
Ain't you heard? His parole's come through.



我就是不明白，发生什么了
I just don't understand what happened in there.



老家伙疯了
Old man's crazy as a rat in a tin shithouse.



够了
That's enough out of you.



-我听说你吓得尿流 -去你妈的
- Heard he had you shitting your pants. - Fuck you.



不要说了！
IKnock it off.



布鲁斯不是疯了
Brooks ain't no bug.



他只是被体制化了
He's just institutionalized.



体制化？什么东西？
"Institutionalized," my ass.



他在此已有五十年了，海伍德，五十年！
The man's been in here 50 years, Heywood, 50 years!



这是他唯一认识的地方
This is all he knows.



在这儿，他是个重要的人
In here, he's an important man...



一个有教养的人
...an educated man.



在外面，他什么都不是
Outside, he's nothing.



只是一个假释出来的囚犯
Just a used-up con with arthritis in both hands.



申请张借书证都有困难
Probably couldn't get a library card if he tried.



你明白我说的话吗？
You know what I'm trying to say?



瑞德，我相信你说是屁话
I do believe you're talking out of your ass.



怎么想随你吧
You believe whatever you want.



我告诉你，这些围墙很有趣的
But I tell you these walls are funny.



开始，你恨它们
First you hate them.



接着，你适应了它们
Then you get used to them.



时间久了
Enough time passes...



你开始离不开它们
...you get so you depend on them.



那就是被体制化了
That's "institutionalized."




Shit.



-我永远不会那样的 -对吗？
- I could never get like that. - Oh, yeah?



因为你没布鲁斯那样长时间在此
Wait till you've been here as long as Brooks.



太对了
Goddamn right.



他们把你送到这里来生活
They send you here for life...



这就是他们确实想要做的
...that's exactly what they take.



无论怎样已经部分达到了
Part that counts, anyway.



我不能再照顾你了，杰克
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.



你走吧
You go on now.



你自由了
You're free.



你自由了
You're free.



布鲁斯，祝你好运
Good luck, Brooksie.



大家好
Dear fellas:



外面的改变令我难以想像
I can't believe how fast things move on the outside.



老头，找死啊？
Watch it, old-timer! Want to get killed?



我童年时只见过一次汽车
I saw an automobile once when I was a kid...



但现在到处都是
... but now they're everywhere.



世界在一片巨大的忙碌之中
The world went and got itself in a big damn hurry.



假释委员会给我安排了中途宿舍
The parole board got me into this halfway house...



叫做“酿酒人”
... called "The Brewer"...



和一份工作
... and a job...



在一家杂货店里包装食物
... bagging groceries at the Food-Way.



虽然很辛苦，但我很努力工作
It's hard work and I try to keep up...



我的手经常感到酸痛
... but my hands hurt most of the time.



记得用两层袋
Make sure your man double-bags.



上次几乎穿底了
Last time, the bottom near came out.



听到那女士说的吗？
Make sure you double-bag like the lady says. Understand?



是的，先生
Yes, sir. Surely will.



我想那店主不太喜欢我
I don't think the store manager likes me very much.



有时工作完后，我到公园里去喂那些鸽子
Sometimes after work, I go to the park and feed the birds.



我一直希望
I keep thinking...



杰克会飞来和我打招呼
... Jake might just show up and say hello.



但它从未来过
But he never does.



我希望，不管在哪，它都过的很好，又交到新朋友
I hope, wherever he is, he's doing okay and making new friends.



晚上我不能入睡
I have trouble sleeping at night.



经常作恶梦，身体像一直往下掉
I have bad dreams like I'm falling.



醒来时感到恐惧
I wake up scared.



要想一会儿才知道自己在哪儿
Sometimes it takes me a while to remember where I am.



也许我该用枪打劫，让他们好送我回家
Maybe I should get a gun and rob the Food-Way so they'd send me home.



我可以打死那个店主，当作额外补助
I could shoot the manager while I was at it. Sort of like a bonus.



但我已经太老了，再也干不了这种蠢事
I guess I'm too old for that sort of nonsense anymore.



我不喜欢这地方
I don't like it here.



它令我感到害怕，我决定……
I'm tired of being afraid all the time. I've decided...



离开
... not to stay.



我怀疑他们会争论
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss...



但不是为我这个老坏蛋
... not for an old crook like me.



“老布来此一游”



我怀疑他们会争论，但不是为我这种老坏蛋
"I doubt they'll kick up any fuss, not for an old crook like me.



另外，跟海伍德说，上次的事很对不起，别放在心上
P.S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry I put a knife to his throat.



不再有痛苦的感觉了，布鲁斯
No hard feelings. Brooks."



他应该死在这儿
He should have died in here.



你该死的做了什么？
What the fuck have you done?



一团糟，我来告诉你
It's a goddamn mess, I'll tell you that.



-这些都是什么？ -你告诉我，全都寄给你的
- What's all this? - You tell me. They're addressed to you.



拿着
Take it.



亲爱的德弗瑞恩先生
"Dear Mr. Dufresne:



应你的来信请求，州政府拨给……
In response to your inquiries...



你的图书馆计划经费

...with a donation of used books and sundries.



这些应是你所需要的，而此事亦告一段落

Good for you, Andy.



哦！
Wow!



只用了六年时间
It only took six years.



由现在起，我每星期写两封信

德弗瑞恩！
Dufresne!



安迪，让我出去

安迪



我到今天也没不明白，这两个意大利女人在唱着什么
I have no idea to this day what those two Italian ladies were singing about.



事实上，我也不想去明白
Truth is, I don't want to know.



有些东西不说更好
Some things are best left unsaid.



我想那是，如此的美
I like to think it was something so beautiful...



无法用语言来形容
... it can't be expressed in words...



美得让你心痛
... and makes your heart ache because of it.



我告诉你，那声音飞翔
I tell you, those voices soared...



比在这个灰暗地方的任何一个人梦想的都要高远
... higher and farther than anybody in a gray place dares to dream.



像一只美丽的小鸟，飞进了我们这灰色的鸟笼
It was like a beautiful bird flapped into our drab cage...



让这些围墙消失了
... and made those walls dissolve away.



在那一刻
And for the briefest of moments...



每个在肖申克的落伍者，感到了的自由
... every last man at Shawshank felt free.



但那令典狱长极度愤怒
It pissed the warden off something awful.



开门
Open the door.



开门！
Open it up!



德弗瑞恩，开门
Dufresne, open this door!



把它关掉！

我警告你，德弗瑞恩！把它关掉
I am warning you. Turn that off!



德弗瑞恩



你落到我手里了
You're mine now.

站起来
On your feet.



-看看谁回来了 -大艺术家！

你就不能放些好听的吗，嗯？比如汉克.威廉姆斯！
You couldn't play something good, huh? Like Hank Williams?



还没来得及接受点播，他们就破门进来了
They broke the door down before I could take requests.



-被关了两周，值得吗？ -那是我最好的时光
- Was it worth two weeks? - Easiest time I ever did.



没有被关小号容易过的事，那个地方一个星期就像一年

对，我有莫扎特先生陪我
- Damn straight. - I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.



他们让你带留声机到那儿？
So they let you tote that record player down there, huh?



它就在这儿
It was in here.



在这儿
In here.



这就是音乐的魅力，他们……
That's the beauty of music. They...



不能把它从你这儿夺走
...can't get that from you.



你们从没此感觉吗？
Haven't you ever felt that way about music?



我年轻时曾学过吹口琴
Well, I played a mean harmonica as a younger man.



可是，现在已经失去兴趣了
Lost interest in it, though.



因为在这里没有任何意义
Didn't make much sense in here.



这里才是它最有意义的地方
Here's where it makes the most sense.



你需要它就不会忘记它

忘记？

我告诉你，我的朋友
Let me tell you something, my friend.



希望是很危险的东西

Sit down.



你因终身监禁在此三十年
Says here that you've served 30 years of a life sentence.



觉得自己被改造了吗？

是的，先生
Oh, yes, sir.



毫无疑问

老实说我己改过

来让他闭嘴

还要擦一下我的鞋子
And shine my shoes.



我要它们看起来像镜子一样亮，好的，先生
- I want them looking like mirrors. - Yes, sir.



你能回来真好，安迪
It's good having you back.



你不在的话，一切都不一样了
Place wasn't the same without you.



熄灯
Lights out!



那是个辗转难眠的长夜
I've had some long nights in stir.



孤独的黑暗中只有思想
Alone in the dark with nothing but your thoughts...



时间像把快刀
... time can draw out like a blade.



那是我一生中最漫长的夜晚
That was the longest night of my life.



清点人数
Give me a count!



南边三楼，人齐了
Tier 3 south, clear!



二楼245囚室的人不见了
Man missing on tier 2, cell 245!



德弗瑞恩！
Dufresne!



快出来！不要耍花样
Come out. You're holding up the show!



别要我下来打爆你的头
Don't make me come down or I'll thump your skull for you!



他妈的，你不要耽误我，我还有很多事要做
Damn it, you're putting me behind! I got a schedule to keep.



你最好是病了或者死了
You'd better be sick or dead in there. I shit you not!



你听到了吗？
You hear me?



啊，我的上帝！
Oh, my Holy God.



查问这里的每一个犯人
I want every man on this cellblock questioned.



-从他的好朋友开始 -谁？
- Start with that friend of his. - Who?



他！



打开237号的门
Open 237.



你什么意思，“他不在这了”？别跟我说这种话
What do you mean, "He just wasn't here"? Don't say that to me.



别再这样说
Don't tell me that again.



但是长官，他真的不在那里
But sir, he wasn't.



我看得见！你认为我瞎了吗？
I can see that, Haig! Think I'm blind?



这就是你想说的吗？
Is that what you're saying?



-我瞎了吗？ -没有！长官
- Am I blind, Haig? - No, sir!



那你呢？你瞎了吗？
What about you. You blind?



-告诉我这是什么？ -昨晚的查房记录
- Tell me what this is. - Last night's count.



你看到德弗瑞恩的名字吗？我确定，就在那里
You see Dufresne's name there? I sure do. Right there.



“德弗瑞恩”
"Dufresne."



他熄灯的时候
He was in his cell...



还在囚室里的
...at lights out.



因此今早他也应该在
Reasonable he'd be here in the morning.



我要找到他
I want him found.



不是明天，不是早饭后，是现在
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast. Now!



是的，长官
Yes, sir.



快走
Let's go. Move your butts.



站好
Stand.



那么？
Well?



那么，什么？
Well, what?



你们常在一起，亲密得像做贼一样
I see you two all the time. You're thick as thieves, you are.



他肯定对你说过些什么
He must have said something.



没有，先生，狱长
No, sir, Warden.



什么都没说
Not a word.



主啊，这是个奇迹
Lord, it's a miracle!



人就像屁一样在风中消失了
Man vanished like a fart in the wind.



什么都没留下
Nothing left...



只剩下窗台上的石头
...but some damn rocks on a windowsill.



和那墙上的小妞，问问她吧
And that cupcake on the wall. Let's ask her.



也许她知道些什么
Maybe she knows.



你想说什么？
What say there, fuzzy-britches? Feel like talking?



我想没有
Guess not.



为什么她有点特别？
Why should she be any different?



这是一个阴谋
This is a conspiracy.



肯定是的
That's what this is.



一个该死的大阴谋
One big, damn conspiracy!



所有人都有参与
And everyone's in on it!



包括她
Including her!



在1966年
In 1966...



安迪·德弗瑞恩从肖申克监狱……
... Andy Dufresne escaped...



逃了出去
... from Shawshank Prison.



他们只能找到泥塘中的囚衣……
All they found was a muddy set of prison clothes...



一块肥皂……
... a bar of soap...



和一个很旧的手槌
... and an old rock hammer...



几乎快被削成一小块
... damn near worn down to the nub.



我曾认为用手槌要六百年才能掘通的隧道
I had thought it'd take a man 600 years to tunnel through the wall with it.



安迪用不到二十年就办到了
Old Andy did it in less than 20.



安迪很喜欢地质学
Oh, Andy loved geology.



我能想像这归功于他一丝不苟的本性
I imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature.



如果这里有一段冰河时期
An ice age here...



百万年后，山脉就会在那里形成
... million years of mountain building there.



地质学是关于压力和时间的研究
Geology is the study of pressure and time.



需要的仅仅就是这些
That's all it takes, really.



压力……
Pressure...



……和时间
... and time.



还有一张大海报
That and a big goddamn poster.



就像我说的那样
Like I said...



监狱里的人都会找事情来消磨时间
... in prison, a man will do anything to keep his mind occupied.



看起来安迪的爱好是把他的墙搬运到广场上
Seems Andy's favorite hobby was toting his wall out into the exercise yard...



每次一把
... a handful at a time.



我猜在汤姆被杀后
I guess after Tommy was killed...



安迪觉得他在此呆得已够久了
... Andy decided he'd been here long enough.



尽快，我要回家了
Lickety-split. I want to get home.



我马上就好了
I'm just about finished, sir.



今晚有三笔存款
Three deposits tonight.



安迪照他的吩咐
Andy did like he was told.



把鞋擦得闪闪发亮
Buffed those shoes to a high mirror-shine.



警卫完全没有注意到
The guards simply didn't notice.



我也没有
Neither did I.



说真的
I mean, seriously...



谁会留意别人穿的鞋子呢？
... how often do you really look at a man's shoes?



安迪朝向自由爬了五百码
Andy crawled to freedom through 500 yards...



我难以想像有多臭的下水道
... of shit-smelling foulness I can't even imagine.



或许我只是不想去爬
Or maybe I just don't want to.



五百码
Five hundred yards.



有五个足球场那么长
That's the length of five football fields.



有半英里左右
Just shy of half a mile.



第二天早上，就在那海报被撕下来的时候
The next morning, right about the time Raquel was spilling her secret...



一个从未出现过的人
... a man nobody ever laid eyes on before...



走进了缅因州国家银行
... strolled into the Maine National Bank.



在那一刻前，他从来是不存在的
Until that moment, he didn't exist.



-除了在纸上 -我可以帮忙吗？
- Except on paper. - May I help you?



他有所有正确的身份证明文件……
He had all the proper ID...



驾驶执照、出生证明、社会安全证……
... driver's license, birth certificate, Social Security card...



签名也是正确的
And the signature was a spot-on match.



不能再为你服务真的很遗憾
I must say I'm sorry to be losing your business.



希望你在国外生活愉快
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.



谢谢
Thank you.



我想我会的
I'm sure I will.



先生，这是你的本票，还有别的吗？
Here's your cashier's check, sir. Will there be anything else?



请问
Please.



你能帮我把它寄出吗？
Would you add this to your outgoing mail?



我很乐意
I'd be happy to.



-再见 -走好，先生
Good day, sir.



史蒂文先生那天早上去了将近十二家银行
Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks in the Portland area that morning.



加起来
All told, he blew town...



他总共提取了三十七万诺顿狱长的钱
... with better than $370,000 of Warden Norton's money.



作为十九年的赔偿
Severance pay for 19 years.



早上好，波特兰时报
Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.



“肖申克监狱,贪污谋杀”



“主的审判迅速降临”



“亲爱的典狱长,你说的对”



“得救之道,就在其中”



拜伦·哈德利？你有权保持沉默
Byron Hadley? You have the right to remain silent.



否则你所说的一切都将对你不利
If you give up this right, anything you say can be held against you in court.



我虽没有亲眼看到，但我听说他被带走时
I wasn't there to see, but I hear Byron Hadley sobbed like a girl...



哭得像个娘们
... when they took him away.



诺顿没有静静离开的意思
Norton had no intention of going that quietly.



森姆·诺顿？
Samuel Norton.



我们有拘捕令，开门！
We have a warrant for your arrest. Open up.



开门吧
Open the door.



我不知是哪把钥匙
I'm not sure which key.



别紧张，诺顿
Make it easy on yourself, Norton!



我想知道当子弹穿过他的头的时候
I like to think the last thing that went through his head...



他在想些什么
... other than that bullet...



是在想该死的安迪.德弗瑞恩到底是如何击败他？
... was to wonder how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.



诺顿狱长一伙倒台之后
Not long after the warden deprived us of his company...



我收到了张明信片
... I got a postcard in the mail.



它是空白的，但是邮戳是……
It was blank, but the postmark said...



汉格堡，德萨斯州的
... Fort Hancock, Texas.



汉格堡
Fort Hancock...



就在边境那里
... right on the border.



安迪就是从那里出国的
That's where Andy crossed.



当我想到他开车向南走的时候
When I picture him heading south in his own car with the top down...



我总会笑起来
... it always makes me laugh.



安迪·德弗瑞恩
Andy Dufresne...



爬过了那臭屎沟
... who crawled through a river of shit...



然后干干净净的到另一边去了
... and came out clean on the other side.



安迪·德弗瑞恩
Andy Dufresne...



向太平洋进发
... headed for the Pacific.



哈德利抓住他的头，对吗？
Hadley's got him by the throat, right?



他说，“我相信他将会发生意外”
He says, " I believe this boy's about to have himself an accident."



我们跟他熟的老是谈起安迪
Those of us who knew him best talk about him often.



我发誓，他总是带来话题
I swear, the stuff he pulled...



“我的朋友可以要两瓶啤酒”
"My friends could use a couple of beers."



他成功了
And he got it!



有时那令我伤心，虽然……
Sometimes it makes me sad, though...



安迪已经离开了
... Andy being gone.



我不得不提醒自己有些鸟是不能关在笼子里的
I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged.



它们的羽毛太光亮
Their feathers are just too bright.



当它们飞走的时候
And when they fly away...



你会觉得把它们关起来是种罪恶
... the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice.



但是
But still...



它们的离开让你生活的地方空荡荡的
... the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they're gone.



可能我只是想念我的朋友了
I guess I just miss my friend.



请坐
Please sit down.



瑞德
Ellis Boyd Redding...



你因终身监禁已被关了40年了
...your files say you've served 40 years of a life sentence.



你觉得你已改过了吗？
You feel you've been rehabilitated?



改过？
Rehabilitated?



让我想想
Well, now, let me see.



我不明白那是什么意思
I don't have any idea what that means.



你有心理准备重新投入社会吗？
It means you're ready to rejoin society...



我知道你们是怎么想的，老弟
I know what you think it means, sonny.



对我来说那只是个用来掩饰的词
To me it's just a made-up word.



政客用的词语
A politician's word so that...



让你们年青人能穿西装打领带
...young fellas like yourself can wear a suit and a tie...



有一份好工作
...and have a job.



你倒底想知道些什么？
What do you really want to know?



我对自己所犯的罪感到后悔吗？
Am I sorry for what I did?



你有后悔吗？
Well, are you?



没有一天我不感到后悔的
There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret.



不是因为我在监狱里，或者你认为我该这样
Not because I'm in here or because you think I should.



我回首过往
I look back on the way I was then...



一个年青的……
...a young...



愚蠢的孩子犯了大罪
...stupid kid who committed that terrible crime.



我想和他谈谈
I want to talk to him.



我想和他讲讲道理
I want to try and talk some sense to him.



告诉他做人道理
Tell him the way things are.



但已经不能了
But I can't.



那孩子已无影无踪
That kid's long gone...



只剩下这个老人
...and this old man is all that's left.



我得这样生活下去
I got to live with that.



改过？
Rehabilitated?



只是个狗屁的字眼
It's just a bullshit word.



你继续盖上你的印章吧，老弟，别再浪费我的时间了
So you go on and stamp your forms, sonny, and stop wasting my time.



说句实话
Because to tell you the truth...



我根本不在乎
...I don't give a shit.



“通过”



“布鲁斯到此”



你的，小姐
Here you go, miss.



我可以去洗手间吗？
Restroom break?



你不用每次都问我，去吧
You don't need to ask me every time you need to go take a piss. Just go.



四十年来我小便都要经过批准
Forty years I've been asking permission to piss.



不批准的话一滴都尿不出来
I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.



现实是很难面对的
There's a harsh truth to face.



我不习惯外面的生活
No way I'm going to make it on the outside.



我总在想怎样才能违反假释条例
All I do anymore is think of ways to break my parole...



那样他们会把我再送进去
... so maybe they'd send me back.



生活在恐惧中是很可怕的
Terrible thing, to live in fear.



布鲁克是知道的
Brooks Hatlen knew it.



他知道得太清楚了
Knew it all too well.



我只想回到能适合我的地方
All I want is to be back where things make sense.



令我不用再担心受怕的地方
Where I won't have to be afraid all the time.



只有一件事阻止了我这么做
Only one thing stops me.



我对安迪作出的承诺
A promise I made to Andy.



就在那里
There it is.



非常感谢，先生
Much obliged, sir.



“布克斯顿”

Dear Red:

你还记得那个地方的名字，是吗？
You remember the name of the town, don't you?



圣哈塔尼奥
Zihuatanejo.



我需要一个人和我一起工作

我一生中第二次……
For the second time in my life...



犯了罪
... I'm guilty of committing a crime.



违反了假释条例
Parole violation.



当然，我怀疑他们会因此设下路障
Of course I doubt they'll toss up any roadblocks for that.



尤其是像我这样的老人家
Not for an old crook like me.



德萨斯州，汉格堡
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.



我发现我很激动，几乎坐不住，思绪纷乱
I find I'm so excited I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head.



这是一个自由人才能感受到的
I think it's the excitement only a free man can feel.



一个自由人开始了漫长的旅程
A free man at the start of a long journey...



伴随着未知的结局
... whose conclusion is uncertain.



我希望我能成功越过边界
I hope I can make it across the border.



我希望看见我的朋友，和他握手

我希望太平洋的海水如我梦中那样的蓝
I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams.



我希望……
I hope.
